to be confused with the Leonardo da Vinci painting of the same name, 'The Baptism of Christ' was painted\n:date: in 1710\nby Flemish artist Aert De Gelder.\n\nIt depicts a hovering, saucer-shaped object shining beams of light down on John the Baptist and Jesus.\n\nAccording to an article by Paul Screeton ([https://www.cantab.net/users/michael.behrend/repubs/j\\_geomancy/v2n2/pages/screeton\\_de_gelder.html),](https://www.cantab.net/users/michael.behrend/repubs/j_geomancy/v2n2/pages/screeton_de_gelder.html), \"‌\") artist Chris Castle describes the artwork as follows:\n\n> It is twilight, a hilltop, a landscape stretches away, the slightly glowing outlines of two towns, then mountains beyond.\n> But on this hill top, a gathering of people in ancient dress gaze motionless, entranced at the scene taking place before them.  Two figures, the one kneedeep in water, head bowed, hands in attitude of prayer, stoops slightly towards the other who with outstretched arms sprinkles him with water.\n> Something momentous indeed has caught the attention of the surrounding onlookers.  The water and the two figures are bathed in a special kind of light, softly glowing.  High in the sky above hovers a greenish disk at the centre of which is a tiny dove with outstretched wings.  From that disk emanate four narrow rays which seem to travel down to earth penetrating the centre of the place/event below.  The rays seem both to support the disk above and to and to come down as a blessing and completion of the baptism.  But the rays themselves are painted in such a way as not to appear as light beams.  Perhaps some other kind of ‘light’ is intended.  The peculiar light quality of the scene is enhanced by the glow of the central event; indeed one feels the water to be charged with some spiritual energy.\n\nThis painting is located at the Fitzwilliam Museum.","id":"5f20a99cee7f0480aebe2442","name":"The Baptism of Christ","idShort":568,"shortLink":"GL738sHP"},"old":{"desc":"Not to be confused with the Leonardo da Vinci painting of the same name, 'The Baptism of Christ' was painted\n📅 in 1710\nby Flemish artist Aert De Gelder.\n\nhttps://www.cantab.net/users/michael.behrend/repubs/j_geomancy/v2n2/pages/screeton_de_gelder.html\n> at the Fitzwilliam Museum\n\nIt depicts a hovering, saucer-shaped object shining beams of light down on John the Baptist and Jesus."},"board":{"id":"5ef6690730145a713865e369","name":"✨ Contact Compendium 💖","shortLink":"B9gQNp9h"},"list":{"id":"5f2091fb19f23352a143569a","name":"🎨 Historical artwork"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"updateCard","date":"2024-08-14T01:48:11.090Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"5ba839acdb687d672de69a97","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5ba839acdb687d672de69a97/c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","fullName":"Felewin-Yang","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"F","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Hunter Bobeck","initials":"HB","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5ba839acdb687d672de69a97/c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","avatarHash":"c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00"},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"felewin"}},{"id":"66b4eceef23a74c56a14c66e","idMemberCreator":"5ba839acdb687d672de69a97","data":{"card":{"desc":"These are illustrations from the 12th century manuscript, ‘Annales Laurissenses’,\n🗺️ from the abbey at Lorsch near Worms in Germany; per:\n🧩 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annales_Laurissenses_minores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annales_Laurissenses_minores \"smartCard-inline\")\n\nThe illustrations document the siege on the Sigiburg Castle in France, in the year 776.

Leopizzi Harris is an Italo-American photojournalist and investigative reporter in the field of extraterrestrial related phenomena research. She is also a widely published freelance writer, especially in Europe. She has studied extraterrestrial related phenomena since 1979 and is on personal terms with many of the leading researchers in the field. From 1980-1986 she assisted Dr. J. Allen Hynek with his UFO investigations and has interviewed many top military witnesses concerning their involvement in the government truth embargo.\n(per https://trello.com/c/QLhUeqRc/889-%F0%9F%8C%90-paola-harris)\n\nIn https://trello.com/c/Oxm7xDFY/1457-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-project-unity-consciousness-conversation-with-paola-harris, Paola described how she got into the subject. She mentions that she still knows the Hyneks well, especially https://trello.com/c/mS2kZGNt/2367-%F0%9F%A5%BD-paul-hynek.\nShe explains that she knew and interviewed several astronauts, including https://trello.com/c/i8tyzoIu/1932-%F0%9F%91%A8%F0%9F%9A%80-astronaut-dr-edgar-mitchell.\n\nPaola started the https://trello.com/c/Sd5i3G4O/2378-%F0%9F%93%9B-starworks-usa-%F0%9F%8E%86, an annual UFO

instance: https://trello.com/c/HPv6KrN6/2124-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-dr-greer-paola-harris) but to give her credit, she also has a great collection of online content 😉: https://trello.com/c/fem8copU/1486-%F0%9F%92%BB-paola-harriss-online-presence.\n\nLately, Paola has been focused on the https://trello.com/c/KCJ0gwlM/1689-%F0%9F%A6%9C-latin-america contact scene

There are many satellites, that are out of control and cannot be used for flare predictions. Hence it happens by accident, that the mirroring panels are in the right geometry with you and still produce a show.

CalSky predicts the opportunities of the show of many tumbling satellites.\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *Geosynchronous (& geostationary) satellites*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n❔ **About geosynchronous satellites:**\n\nA 'geosynchronous' satellite is one having a period of rotation synchronous with that of the Earth's rotation. This means that if the Earth has rotated, say, exactly 67 times, the satellite will have rotated exactly 67 times as well.\nSuch a satellite may orbit the Earth at any angle; this could be along the equator, from pole to pole, etc.\nTo say that a satellite is geosynchronous thus is like saying that it makes a rotation in the same rhythm that the Earth makes a rotation (regardless of which direction it makes that rotation in). If the Earth and the satellite were to both play a note of music every time they complete one orbit, then they would be playing notes at the same frequency.\n\n----\n\n❔ **About geostationary satellites:**\n\nIf a geosynchronous satellite is also rotating so that it follows above a certain location on the Earth (as if locked to that location by a long, straight rod: http://skyandtelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/Geosynchronous_orbit-wiki.gif), then it is called 'geostationary', in addition to being geosynchronous. (All geostationary satellites are geosynchronous.)\n\nThese satellites are often referred to as \"geosats\", for short, or even \"geos\".\n\n----\n\n💻 **Simulation:**\n\nScott Manley demonstrates the terms 'geostationary' and 'geosynchronous' with a simulation of satellites around the Earth, using Universe Sandbox 2, at the following timestamp (until 9:11):\n▶️ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZAkiXNJIqc&t=360\nHe first demonstrates geostationary orbit, then changes the satellite simulation to no longer have a geostationary orbit, but still a geosynchronous one. This helps to visualize the geostationary distinction of geosynchronous satellites.\n\n----\n\n📹 **Geostationary satellite example footage:**\n\n'Geostationary & Medium Earth Orbit Night vision satellite & UFO Hunting'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/2CM3N4RXLTg\n\n'Flares of Geostationary Satellites'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/_wmrZPU9jcg\n\n'Geo Flasher'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/DDuX3BxKo08\n\n'GEO flares 24 09 14'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/yCfOvGidP5A\n\n'Galaxy 26 - dead geostationary satellite flashes'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/bgrgujPc6JM\n\n----\n\n📷 **Geostationary satellite example photos:**\n\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/\n\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n\n----\n\n**🔬 Example geostationary satellite determinations:**\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn (on https://trello.com/b/SfOqk4j7/published-sighting-analyses)\n\n----\n\n💥 **Geostationary satellite flashing appearance:**\n\n• While the term flashing is often used to describe the brightening of geostationary satellites, 'flaring' seems more appropriate, based on the example footage. The example footage is more reminiscent of iridium flares \"flaring\" (like \"powering up\" gradually).\n\n• This site describes geosynchronous satellites as potentially \"flaring\", not \"flashing\":\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n> If you make a point to look for geosats shortly before they enter or shortly after they leave the shadow, you might catch a flare, some of which are bright enough to see in binoculars and rarely, with the naked eye.\n\n• The following case exhibits what is best described as \"flashing\", but was later confirmed to be a geostationary satellite:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n🌟 **Geostationary satellite brightness magnitudes:**\n\n• Anywhere from 14th to 5th magnitude is typical. A quite bright outlier at 3rd magnitude has been reported.\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html:\n> Typically the satellite will be in the mag. +11 to +14 range (or dimmer), but brightening by several magnitudes when the geometry is favourable (around mag. +5 to +6 is not untypical). One satellite is reported to have briefly been visible to the naked eye at mag. +3 !\n\n• A flash as bright as 1st magnitude is possible.\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/:\n> Some satellites at this high altitude will flash to naked eye brightness. As an example here is Telstar 401 which was recorded 11/26/00. It flashed up to +1 magnitude though some of its flashes were not quite naked eye brightness.\n\n• The following case exhibits a magnitude around 1.19, the magnitude of Saturn (which was nearby):\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n• However, it's rare to catch a flare of a geostationary satellite with the naked eye.\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n> If you make a point to look for geosats shortly before they enter or shortly after they leave the shadow, you might catch a flare, some of which are bright enough to see in binoculars and rarely, with the naked eye.\n\n----\n\n⌚ **Geostationary satellite flashing intervals:**\n\n• Of the example footage found, the most frequent interval between flashes was about 10 seconds.\n\n• A common interval is usually 15-45 seconds between flashes. For instance, one data point records a 38 second flash period:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html\n\n• However, they have at least been known to flash as often as 5 seconds;\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/:\n> Sometimes the big flash was preceded by another smaller one 5 seconds before hand. Here is the first faint flash.\n...\n> The next image shows the much more distinct and brighter, 3rd magnitude flash which occurred 5 seconds later.\n\n• The following case exhibits a flashing interval of just over 3 seconds:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n☀️ **Geostationary satellite equinox relationship:**\n\n• This site describes the significance of equinoxes with regard to geostationary satellites:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html\n> Unlike objects in low Earth orbit, geostationary satellites are visible throughout every night of the year, only entering the Earth's shadow for up to 70 minutes per day, around a couple of weeks either side of each equinox. During the same period the satellite tends to brighten over several days, twice a year, when the satellites orientation favors the 'beaming' of the Sun in the direction of the observer.\n...\n> As pointed out above it is more rewarding to carry this out around the Spring and Fall equinoxes when the satellite will be more apparent. Observations over successive nights before and after this time will allow you to view the brightening of the object, plus its entry and exit from the Earth's shadow. Of course this will also avoid the disappointment of searching for it whilst it is in eclipse!\n\n• The following case took place 10 days before the 2020 autumnal equinox:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n📅 **Geostationary satellite predictions:**\n\n• https://trello.com/c/JZc2Fdzh/2611-%F0%9F%92%BB-stellarium-%F0%9F%A4%A9 can include geostationary satellites, perhaps the most of any reference.\n\n• The following site allows entry of latitude, longitude, and date to apparently return a list of possible geostationary satellite sightings and key info such as their expected magnitudes and their astrological location, allowing quick deduction as to whether a possible geostationary satellite sighting was predicted.\n🌐https://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/10\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *Secret/spy satellites*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n❔ **Some background:**\n\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/spy-satellites/\n\n----\n\n----\n\nCheck out further https://trello.com/c/NRW3PmdB/2066-%F0%9F%94%AD-skywatching-reference."},"card":{"desc":"https://trello.com/c/JZc2Fdzh/2611-%F0%9F%92%BB-stellarium-%F0%9F%A4%A9\n----------------\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *SpaceX Starlink*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n📹 **Example footage:**\n▶️ https://youtu.be/vkZpusxb0iM\n\n----\n\n❔ **About:**\nStarlink is a satellite constellation from SpaceX that provides internet access around the world.\nThese satellites often appear in an obvious sequence, almost like traincars.\n🧩 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *Iridium satellite flares*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n📹 **Example footage:**\n▶️ https://youtu.be/MTGVuPr9Epg\n▶️ https://youtu.be/1PFUP5LPyuA\n▶️ https://youtu.be/fI_iUOeJEGg\n\n----\n\n📷 **Example photos:**\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/iridium-satellites/\n\n----\n\n❔ **About:**\n🧩 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_flare#Iridium_flares\nBe sure to distinguish https://trello.com/c/43Es08Gs/2801-powerups-%F0%9F%92%A1 from iridium flares.\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *Tumbling satellites*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n📹 **Example footage:**\n\n'Chinese reconnaissance satellite Yaogan 6 tumbling and flashing'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/i8hAq51nYXY\n\n'JAXA Satellite's Out-Of-Control Tumble Captured By Amateur Astronomer'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/ZkHAJYp_q3A\n\n'Oct 30 2014 0406 Satellite Flashing Near Betelgeuse'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/lewotn8QMC4\n\n'tumbling satellite 22-07-15'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/VgqHKIiYRoM\n\n'Night vision, tumbling satellite.'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/-nMR_V7ZI4I\n\n----\n\n❔ **About:**\n\n• This site offers a detailed introduction to tumbling satellites:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/tumble/tumbleintro.html\n\n----\n\n⌚ **Tumbling satellite flashing intervals:**\n\n• This site offers a range of possible flashing intervals:\n🌐 https://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/9:\n> Each of the tumblers has its own characteristic flashing pattern - some with a period of only 1 seconds, where others flash every 40 seconds.\n\n• This site recounts a short tumbling satellite flashing interval:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/tumble/tumbleintro.html:\nIt is recorded that one tumbling satellite had a flash period of only 2.18 seconds.\n\n----\n\n📅 **Tumbling satellite predictions:**\n\n• https://trello.com/c/JZc2Fdzh/2611-%F0%9F%92%BB-stellarium-%F0%9F%A4%A9 is worth checking out; it is probably the most comprehensive and useful reference.\n\n• The following site allows entry of latitude, longitude, and date to apparently return a list of possible tumbling satellite sightings and key info such as their expected magnitudes and their appearance and disappearance times, allowing quick deduction as to whether a possible tumbling satellite sighting was predicted.\n🌐 https://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/9\n> The prediction of satellite flares is only possible in case the satellite is still controlled.

This helps to visualize the geostationary distinction of geosynchronous satellites.\n\n----\n\n📹 **Geostationary satellite example footage:**\n\n'Geostationary & Medium Earth Orbit Night vision satellite & UFO Hunting'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/2CM3N4RXLTg\n\n'Flares of Geostationary Satellites'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/_wmrZPU9jcg\n\n'Geo Flasher'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/DDuX3BxKo08\n\n'GEO flares 24 09 14'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/yCfOvGidP5A\n\n'Galaxy 26 - dead geostationary satellite flashes'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/bgrgujPc6JM\n\n----\n\n📷 **Geostationary satellite example photos:**\n\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/\n\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n\n----\n\n**🔬 Example geostationary satellite determinations:**\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn (on https://trello.com/b/SfOqk4j7/published-sighting-analyses)\n\n----\n\n💥 **Geostationary satellite flashing appearance:**\n\n• While the term flashing is often used to describe the brightening of geostationary satellites, 'flaring' seems more appropriate, based on the example footage. The example footage is more reminiscent of iridium flares \"flaring\" (like \"powering up\" gradually).\n\n• This site describes geosynchronous satellites as potentially \"flaring\", not \"flashing\":\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n> If you make a point to look for geosats shortly before they enter or shortly after they leave the shadow, you might catch a flare, some of which are bright enough to see in binoculars and rarely, with the naked eye.\n\n• The following case exhibits what is best described as \"flashing\", but was later confirmed to be a geostationary satellite:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n🌟 **Geostationary satellite brightness magnitudes:**\n\n• Anywhere from 14th to 5th magnitude is typical. A quite bright outlier at 3rd magnitude has been reported.\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html:\n> Typically the satellite will be in the mag. +11 to +14 range (or dimmer), but brightening by several magnitudes when the geometry is favourable (around mag. +5 to +6 is not untypical). One satellite is reported to have briefly been visible to the naked eye at mag. +3 !\n\n• A flash as bright as 1st magnitude is possible.\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/:\n> Some satellites at this high altitude will flash to naked eye brightness. As an example here is Telstar 401 which was recorded 11/26/00. It flashed up to +1 magnitude though some of its flashes were not quite naked eye brightness.\n\n• The following case exhibits a magnitude around 1.19, the magnitude of Saturn (which was nearby):\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n• However, it's rare to catch a flare of a geostationary satellite with the naked eye.\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n> If you make a point to look for geosats shortly before they enter or shortly after they leave the shadow, you might catch a flare, some of which are bright enough to see in binoculars and rarely, with the naked eye.\n\n----\n\n⌚ **Geostationary satellite flashing intervals:**\n\n• Of the example footage found, the most frequent interval between flashes was about 10 seconds.\n\n• A common interval is usually 15-45 seconds between flashes. For instance, one data point records a 38 second flash period:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html\n\n• However, they have at least been known to flash as often as 5 seconds;\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/:\n> Sometimes the big flash was preceded by another smaller one 5 seconds before hand. Here is the first faint flash.\n...\n> The next image shows the much more distinct and brighter, 3rd magnitude flash which occurred 5 seconds later.\n\n• The following case exhibits a flashing interval of just over 3 seconds:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n☀️ **Geostationary satellite equinox relationship:**\n\n• This site describes the significance of equinoxes with regard to geostationary satellites:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html\n> Unlike objects in low Earth orbit, geostationary satellites are visible throughout every night of the year, only entering the Earth's shadow for up to 70 minutes per day, around a couple of weeks either side of each equinox. During the same period the satellite tends to brighten over several days, twice a year, when the satellites orientation favors the 'beaming' of the Sun in the direction of the observer.\n...\n> As pointed out above it is more rewarding to carry this out around the Spring and Fall equinoxes when the satellite will be more apparent. Observations over successive nights before and after this time will allow you to view the brightening of the object, plus its entry and exit from the Earth's shadow. Of course this will also avoid the disappointment of searching for it whilst it is in eclipse!\n\n• The following case took place 10 days before the 2020 autumnal equinox:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n📅 **Geostationary satellite predictions:**\n\n• https://trello.com/c/JZc2Fdzh/2611-%F0%9F%92%BB-stellarium-%F0%9F%A4%A9 can include geostationary satellites, perhaps the most of any reference.\n\n• The following site allows entry of latitude, longitude, and date to apparently return a list of possible geostationary satellite sightings and key info such as their expected magnitudes and their astrological location, allowing quick deduction as to whether a possible geostationary satellite sighting was predicted.\n🌐https://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/10\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *Secret/spy satellites*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n❔

There were other \"VIP/Celeb\" folks there who also did not want to be live.\n\nSupposedly the plan they came up with was to make contact for 5 nights in a row.\n\nKnown CSETI team members flew to Joshua Tree to participate in this event with https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F and https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4, including but not limited to:\nMarcel Vidovic\nKimberly Marie\nRicky Butterfass\n\n----\n\nThis was preceded by https://trello.com/c/u5rLBLKk/2796-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-greers-announcement-of-livestreamed-meditation-with-demi-lovato.\n\nNext came the news coverage:\nhttps://trello.com/c/PsOe011y/2831-%F0%9F%97%9E%EF%B8%8F-demi-lovato-dr-greer-doing-ce-5-at-joshua-tree\n\n----\n\nCheck out more about https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F.","id":"5f8a820bcc90526e5d44f8b6","name":"▶️ Dr. Steven Greer & Demi Lovato Contact Meditation","idShort":2826,"shortLink":"IiN6jZ3k"},"board":{"id":"5ef6690730145a713865e369","name":"✨ Contact Compendium 💖","shortLink":"B9gQNp9h"},"list":{"id":"5f67becfc5255a5ad8186022","name":"👩‍🎤 Demi Lovato 🎤"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"updateCard","date":"2020-10-30T17:48:19.172Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"5ba839acdb687d672de69a97","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5ba839acdb687d672de69a97/c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","fullName":"Felewin-Yang","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"F","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Hunter Bobeck","initials":"HB","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5ba839acdb687d672de69a97/c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","avatarHash":"c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00"},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"felewin"}},{"id":"5f9a1c610cb5f338e05c0a5d","idMemberCreator":"5ba839acdb687d672de69a97","data":{"old":{"desc":"❔ About\n----------------\n\n----\n\nHarvard psychiatrist John Mack studied this case, visiting the school and interviewing the children involved:\n🌐 http://johnemackinstitute.org/1995/03/exploring-african-and-other-alien-encounters/\n> John Mack and I were at the Ariel School, a small elementary school outside Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, listening to Elsa (not her real name) describe her encounter last September 16 [1994] with an “alien” being.

Seeming unrelated events are actually all related, since they are one and the same, and only words (pretend to) divide them.\n\n----\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/GkEB2sJ0/1540-nassim-haramein-on-heart-coherence-%F0%9F%92%96\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/j948hCNd/1691-the-role-temperament-of-the-apunians-and-the-importance-of-having-a-heart-connection\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/7o27SdgJ/2482-the-need-for-contactees-to-tell-people-as-though-being-%F0%9F%92%96-activated-and-%F0%9F%92%AB-synchronistic-guidance-%F0%9F%9B%A4%EF%B8%8F\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/AUec9OUH/1503-jay-of-project-unity-paola-harris-discuss-synchronicity-%F0%9F%92%AB\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/gqCKRGVY/788-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-on-coherence\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/464LG892/528-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-mat%C3%ADas-de-stefanos-january-2020-discussion-meditation-on-the-saturn-%F0%9F%AA%90-and-pluto-alignment-coherent-earth-consciousness-%F0%9F%8C%8E\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/MqdOkAOu/2595-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-paola-harris-jimmy-church-discuss-synchronicities\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/PoliJhDe/146-%F0%9F%93%9D-in-this-document-available-on-the-official-cia-website-a-comprehensive-review-of-various-forms-of-meditation-regarding-the-mon on https://trello.com/b/WtJPGwF0/intuition\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/zdtf7Ujd/56-hemi-sync-%F0%9F%8E%A7 on https://trello.com/b/WtJPGwF0/intuition\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/Yu1mlqS7/1455-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-abraham-hicks-on-synchronicity-the-vortex\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/3Ja2lhuV/675-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-dean-radin-phd-on-coherence-creating-statistical-order\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/0pUgOuKT/1280-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-dr-joe-dispenza-explains-his-transcendental-meditation-biological-chain-reaction-breathing-technique-%F0%9F%8C%AC%EF%B8%8F\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/KSzvOwEE/1445-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-dr-dispenza-on-synchronicities-through-heart-coherence\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/1Ow84Mec/78-%F0%9F%8E%A5-the-animal-communicator on https://trello.com/b/WtJPGwF0/intuition\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/jEzYO5lm/995-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-joe-martino-on-the-natural-progression-of-interconnectedness-from-life-on-earth-to-the-cosmos\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/jSSN39RG/1608-dalai-lama-on-treating-extraterrestrials-respectfully-as-fellow-sentient-beings\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/EXNTCcWk/2675-%F0%9F%A5%B0-the-peoples-love-alliance\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/FykFJ9B3/1304-%E2%9E%95%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F-heartmath\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/DcDnLkSN/1264-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-transcendental-meditation-practice-has-been-a-success-story-in-schools\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/sGkebmuy/1491-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-i-found-the-hidden-energy-vortexes-%F0%9F%8C%80-in-sedona\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/ChUpVkpL/1527-%F0%9F%8C%AC%EF%B8%8F-the-wim-hof-method-induces-coherence\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/xCWekXzl/1453-especially-also-see","id":"5f518a20f3d4fb3232a7fe98","name":"💖 Heart coherence, toruses, synchronicity, & vortices 🌀","idShort":1595,"shortLink":"iK6YC36X"},"board":{"id":"5ef6690730145a713865e369","name":"✨ Contact Compendium 💖","shortLink":"B9gQNp9h"},"list":{"id":"5f24b76582e7043bd361b0d3","name":"💖 Heart coherence, toruses, synchronicity, & vortices 🌀"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"updateCard","date":"2020-10-28T03:29:00.647Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"5ba839acdb687d672de69a97","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5ba839acdb687d672de69a97/c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","fullName":"Felewin-Yang","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"F","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Hunter Bobeck","initials":"HB","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5ba839acdb687d672de69a97/c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","avatarHash":"c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00"},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"felewin"}},{"id":"5f98cf618c9d0266588df6d3","idMemberCreator":"5ba839acdb687d672de69a97","data":{"old":{"closed":false},"card":{"closed":true,"id":"5f98acbc0997040e6b8f2c80","name":"🎵 Enigma -

Over the past couple months I have dug deep into the science of consciousness and experienced not only peace and serenity like I’ve never known but I also have witnessed the most incredibly profound sightings both in the sky as well as feet away from me. This planet is on a very negative path towards destruction but WE can change that together. If we were to get 1% of the population to meditate and make contact, we would force our governments to acknowledge the truth about extraterrestrial life among us and change our destructive habits destroying our planet. This is just some of the evidence from under the stars in the desert sky that can no longer be ignored and must be shared immediately 💞💫☄️ to make contact yourself you can download the CE5 app {https://trello.com/c/3bVj6FWz/185-%F0%9F%93%B2-ce-5-contact-app} and it will teach you the protocols to connect to life form beyond our planet!! (Ps, if it doesn’t happen on the first try - keep trying - it took me several sessions to tap into a deep enough level of meditation to make contact!) Happy communicating 💞🙏🏼\n\nCheck out https://trello.com/c/7IxZojeX/2842-those-celebrities-who-showed-interest-in-demi-lovatos-joshua-tree-ce-5-footage.\n\n----\n\nLater reports\n----------------\n\n📅 A week later, on 20/10/24,\nhttps://trello.com/c/5sTSwuVr/892-human-initiated-contact-marcel-vidovic uploaded a much longer video of footage from the event:\n'CE-5 with Dr. Greer & Demi Levato, Joshua Tree, CA, October 15, 2020':\n{made private} ▶️ https://youtu.be/nUjqBXZHK_Q\nThat upload was made private, a similar or identical upload was shared here:\n▶️ https://youtu.be/HFRQ2-3DgFo\n> A small group gathered for a CE-5 contact event with celebrity guest Demi Lovato. The mystery craft descended, then flew from east to west direction for about 6 minutes. There was no sound and there were no strobe lights visible to the naked eye or through two night vision binoculars. Possibly an alleged plane with no strobes? or alleged cloaked extraterrestrial vehicle? One of many sightings that night.  \n\nPeter Chan also writes:\n> Team San Diego HICE also attend Joshua Tree October 15,16,17 and 18 in concert with Marcel Vidovic,  Greer and companies.   Neither parties knew our attendance plans.  The universe at play yet again. \nFriday (4 attend) site 1\nI saw the blue flag bulb above Ryan. \nJim Rawson had three knocks on his bedroom door at midnight. Freaked him out he left the next morning. \nThe three knocks on the door is a common occurrence I've recieved them twice. \nSaturday (6 attend) site 2\nMy phone emf goes off in the house and in the field\n@Cam Herndon sees double columns of light flash bulb third eye a ship. \n@Julian Mota and I sees flash bulbs separately same area.   Then I see two meteors in parrellel very unnatural. \n@Cam Herndon talks about Dan Ankrold men in black then Ryan's radar detector goes crazy. Also we discuss teaching for free and non profit for this group.   Confirmation by the radar detector via 👽👽👽.\nSteve sees the squiggle vertical light lines. \nSteve and I both see the huge white glowing object from the west goes straight then upwards. I figure the end of the show.   Then I was thinking it's all over then Ryan's radar detector goes off again. \nSunday (two attend) site 2\nI see flash bulbs\nRyan and I see the white glowing object the same as Saturday with Steve. \nI see an oval green glowing object flying north to south like a meteor without the tail looks like the object described by @Mark Sims 2012Nov. \nRyan plays practical joke leaves me behind drives off (not the first time) comes back I point upwards flash bulb then super bright flash bulb right above the car.\n\n----\n\nOn prerecordedness and the schedule\n----------------\n\nThis was definitely prerecorded given that Youtube doesn't have a function to premiere a livestream, only an uploaded video file; and it was in fact a premiere (as made clear by the usual Youtube premiere countdown shortly before the appointed start time).\n\nThe fact that it was prerecorded may explain why https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 's other event this day (https://twitter.com/ddlovato/status/1317160743339388929) at 8:45 PM PST wasn't a conflict; additionally, that event may have been prerecorded as well.

The mystery craft descended, then flew from east to west direction for about 6 minutes.

Over the past couple months I have dug deep into the science of consciousness and experienced not only peace and serenity like I’ve never known but I also have witnessed the most incredibly profound sightings both in the sky as well as feet away from me. This planet is on a very negative path towards destruction but WE can change that together. If we were to get 1% of the population to meditate and make contact, we would force our governments to acknowledge the truth about extraterrestrial life among us and change our destructive habits destroying our planet. This is just some of the evidence from under the stars in the desert sky that can no longer be ignored and must be shared immediately 💞💫☄️ to make contact yourself you can download the CE5 app {https://trello.com/c/3bVj6FWz/185-%F0%9F%93%B2-ce-5-contact-app} and it will teach you the protocols to connect to life form beyond our planet!! (Ps, if it doesn’t happen on the first try - keep trying - it took me several sessions to tap into a deep enough level of meditation to make contact!) Happy communicating 💞🙏🏼\n\nCheck out https://trello.com/c/7IxZojeX/2842-those-celebrities-who-showed-interest-in-demi-lovatos-joshua-tree-ce-5-footage.\n\n----\n\nLater reports\n----------------\n\n📅 A week later, on 20/10/24,\nhttps://trello.com/c/5sTSwuVr/892-human-initiated-contact-marcel-vidovic uploaded a much longer video of footage from the event:\n'CE-5 with Dr. Greer & Demi Levato, Joshua Tree, CA, October 15, 2020':\n▶️ https://youtu.be/nUjqBXZHK_Q\nThat upload was made private, a similar or identical upload was shared here:\n▶️ https://youtu.be/HFRQ2-3DgFo\n> A small group gathered for a CE-5 contact event with celebrity guest Demi Lovato. The mystery craft descended, then flew from east to west direction for about 6 minutes. There was no sound and there were no strobe lights visible to the naked eye or through two night vision binoculars. Possibly an alleged plane with no strobes? or alleged cloaked extraterrestrial vehicle? One of many sightings that night.  \n\nPeter Chan also writes:\n> Team San Diego HICE also attend Joshua Tree October 15,16,17 and 18 in concert with Marcel Vidovic,  Greer and companies.   Neither parties knew our attendance plans.  The universe at play yet again. \nFriday (4 attend) site 1\nI saw the blue flag bulb above Ryan. \nJim Rawson had three knocks on his bedroom door at midnight. Freaked him out he left the next morning. \nThe three knocks on the door is a common occurrence I've recieved them twice. \nSaturday (6 attend) site 2\nMy phone emf goes off in the house and in the field\n@Cam Herndon sees double columns of light flash bulb third eye a ship. \n@Julian Mota and I sees flash bulbs separately same area.   Then I see two meteors in parrellel very unnatural. \n@Cam Herndon talks about Dan Ankrold men in black then Ryan's radar detector goes crazy. Also we discuss teaching for free and non profit for this group.   Confirmation by the radar detector via 👽👽👽.\nSteve sees the squiggle vertical light lines. \nSteve and I both see the huge white glowing object from the west goes straight then upwards. I figure the end of the show.   Then I was thinking it's all over then Ryan's radar detector goes off again. \nSunday (two attend) site 2\nI see flash bulbs\nRyan and I see the white glowing object the same as Saturday with Steve. \nI see an oval green glowing object flying north to south like a meteor without the tail looks like the object described by @Mark Sims 2012Nov. \nRyan plays practical joke leaves me behind drives off (not the first time) comes back I point upwards flash bulb then super bright flash bulb right above the car.\n\n----\n\nOn prerecordedness and the schedule\n----------------\n\nThis was definitely prerecorded given that Youtube doesn't have a function to premiere a livestream, only an uploaded video file; and it was in fact a premiere (as made clear by the usual Youtube premiere countdown shortly before the appointed start time).\n\nThe fact that it was prerecorded may explain why https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 's other event this day (https://twitter.com/ddlovato/status/1317160743339388929) at 8:45 PM PST wasn't a conflict; additionally, that event may have been prerecorded as well.

This planet is on a very negative path towards destruction but WE can change that together. If we were to get 1% of the population to meditate and make contact, we would force our governments to acknowledge the truth about extraterrestrial life among us and change our destructive habits destroying our planet.

The mystery craft descended, then flew from east to west direction for about 6 minutes. There was no sound and there were no strobe lights visible to the naked eye or through two night vision binoculars. Possibly an alleged plane with no strobes? or alleged cloaked extraterrestrial vehicle? One of many sightings that night.  \n\nPeter Chan also writes:\n> Team San Diego HICE also attend Joshua Tree October 15,16,17 and 18 in concert with Marcel Vidovic,  Greer and companies.   Neither parties knew our attendance plans.  The universe at play yet again. \nFriday (4 attend) site 1\nI saw the blue flag bulb above Ryan. \nJim Rawson had three knocks on his bedroom door at midnight. Freaked him out he left the next morning. \nThe three knocks on the door is a common occurrence I've recieved them twice. \nSaturday (6 attend) site 2\nMy phone emf goes off in the house and in the field\n@Cam Herndon sees double columns of light flash bulb third eye a ship. \n@Julian Mota and I sees flash bulbs separately same area.   Then I see two meteors in parrellel very unnatural. \n@Cam Herndon talks about Dan Ankrold men in black then Ryan's radar detector goes crazy. Also we discuss teaching for free and non profit for this group.   Confirmation by the radar detector via 👽👽👽.\nSteve sees the squiggle vertical light lines. \nSteve and I both see the huge white glowing object from the west goes straight then upwards. I figure the end of the show.   Then I was thinking it's all over then Ryan's radar detector goes off again. \nSunday (two attend) site 2\nI see flash bulbs\nRyan and I see the white glowing object the same as Saturday with Steve. \nI see an oval green glowing object flying north to south like a meteor without the tail looks like the object described by @Mark Sims 2012Nov. \nRyan plays practical joke leaves me behind drives off (not the first time) comes back I point upwards flash bulb then super bright flash bulb right above the car.\n\n----\n\nOn prerecordedness and the schedule\n----------------\n\nThis was definitely prerecorded given that Youtube doesn't have a function to premiere a livestream, only an uploaded video file; and it was in fact a premiere (as made clear by the usual Youtube premiere countdown shortly before the appointed start time).\n\nThe fact that it was prerecorded may explain why https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 's other event this day (https://twitter.com/ddlovato/status/1317160743339388929) at 8:45 PM PST wasn't a conflict; alternatively, that event may have been prerecorded as well.

Over the past couple months I have dug deep into the science of consciousness and experienced not only peace and serenity like I’ve never known but I also have witnessed the most incredibly profound sightings both in the sky as well as feet away from me. This planet is on a very negative path towards destruction but WE can change that together. If we were to get 1% of the population to meditate and make contact, we would force our governments to acknowledge the truth about extraterrestrial life among us and change our destructive habits destroying our planet. This is just some of the evidence from under the stars in the desert sky that can no longer be ignored and must be shared immediately 💞💫☄️ to make contact yourself you can download the CE5 app {https://trello.com/c/3bVj6FWz/185-%F0%9F%93%B2-ce-5-contact-app} and it will teach you the protocols to connect to life form beyond our planet!! (Ps, if it doesn’t happen on the first try - keep trying - it took me several sessions to tap into a deep enough level of meditation to make contact!) Happy communicating 💞🙏🏼\n\nCheck out https://trello.com/c/7IxZojeX/2842-those-celebrities-who-showed-interest-in-demi-lovatos-joshua-tree-ce-5-footage.\n\n📅 A week later, on 20/10/24,\nhttps://trello.com/c/5sTSwuVr/892-human-initiated-contact-marcel-vidovic uploaded a much longer video footage from the event:\n'CE-5 with Dr. Greer & Demi Levato, Joshua Tree, CA, October 15, 2020':\n▶️ https://youtu.be/nUjqBXZHK_Q\n\n----\n\nOn prerecordedness and the schedule\n----------------\n\nThis was definitely prerecorded given that Youtube doesn't have a function to premiere a livestream, only an uploaded video file; and it was in fact a premiere (as made clear by the usual Youtube premiere countdown shortly before the appointed start time).\n\nThe fact that it was prerecorded may explain why https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 's other event this day (https://twitter.com/ddlovato/status/1317160743339388929) at 8:45 PM PST wasn't a conflict; alternatively, that event may have been prerecorded as well. That seems likely, in which case https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 was at Joshua Tree for likely all of 20/10/16.\n\nIt's also apparent that https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 was there for at least the evening and later on 20/10/15, given the text overlayed onto the sighting photos in those two attached sighting photo images, and that there was the (failed) attempt at a livestream that day.\nAccording to Greer's team, Greer was with Demi since 20/10/13 at Joshua Tree. They tried to go live several times, but \"at the house there was virtually no internet\" and Demi's people weren't okay with her being livestreamed (they \"must review and approve any content she puts out\"). There were other \"VIP/Celeb\" folks there who also did not want to be live.\n\nSupposedly the plan they came up with was to make contact for 5 nights in a row.\n\nKnown CSETI team members (additional names withheld for privacy) flew to Joshua Tree to participate in this event with https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F and https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4.\n\n----\n\nThis was preceded by https://trello.com/c/u5rLBLKk/2796-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-greers-announcement-of-livestreamed-meditation-with-demi-lovato.\n\nNext came the news coverage:\nhttps://trello.com/c/PsOe011y/2831-%F0%9F%97%9E%EF%B8%8F-demi-lovato-dr-greer-doing-ce-5-at-joshua-tree\n\n----\n\nCheck out more about https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F."},"card":{"desc":"Failed initial livestream\n----------------\n\n▶️ https://youtu.be/fhYFJtCKr6I\n\n📅 20/10/15\n\nInterestingly, this same night, https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 's 'Commander In Chief' music video –\n▶️ https://youtu.be/n9Y-lS1trhw\n– was the #2 trending video worldwide on Youtube:\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/73344a7c5402e1321631f8a26c61b731.png\n\n----\n\nYoutube premiere and social media activity\n----------------\n\n▶️ https://youtu.be/ZCHcJ_CBnzs\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F and https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 did https://trello.com/c/0mjbV10S/2132-ce-5-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F.\n\nThis was a prerecorded Youtube video that\n📅 premiered on 20/10/16 at 7:30 PST\n🗺️ at Joshua Tree National Park, California, United States.\n\n📎 Around when the premiere happened, the two attached images containing photos of apparent recent sightings in the sky while with https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 were in https://trello.com/c/BFe9llWE/2083-%F0%9F%93%B8-dr-steven-greer 's Story.\n📸 A clip from the Youtube video was in his Story as well.\n\nVivian Kubrick (who Greer follows on https://trello.com/c/s6hIOqGX/1418-%F0%9F%90%A4-dr-steven-greer) Tweeted about this event:\nhttps://twitter.com/ViKu1111/status/1317298127284719618?s=19\n\n📸 The next day, https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 posted footage to Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CGb6T3HBtch/\n📅 20/10/17\n> The past few days I’ve spent in Joshua Tree with a small group of loved ones and @dr.steven.greer {https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F} and his CE5 {https://trello.com/c/0mjbV10S/2132-ce-5-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F} team.

Over the past couple months I have dug deep into the science of consciousness and experienced not only peace and serenity like I’ve never known but I also have witnessed the most incredibly profound sightings both in the sky as well as feet away from me. This planet is on a very negative path towards destruction but WE can change that together. If we were to get 1% of the population to meditate and make contact, we would force our governments to acknowledge the truth about extraterrestrial life among us and change our destructive habits destroying our planet. This is just some of the evidence from under the stars in the desert sky that can no longer be ignored and must be shared immediately 💞💫☄️ to make contact yourself you can download the CE5 app {https://trello.com/c/3bVj6FWz/185-%F0%9F%93%B2-ce-5-contact-app} and it will teach you the protocols to connect to life form beyond our planet!! (Ps, if it doesn’t happen on the first try - keep trying - it took me several sessions to tap into a deep enough level of meditation to make contact!) Happy communicating 💞🙏🏼\n\nCheck out https://trello.com/c/7IxZojeX/2842-those-celebrities-who-showed-interest-in-demi-lovatos-joshua-tree-ce-5-footage.\n\nA week later, on 20/10/24\n\n----\n\nOn prerecordedness and the schedule\n----------------\n\nThis was definitely prerecorded given that Youtube doesn't have a function to premiere a livestream, only an uploaded video file; and it was in fact a premiere (as made clear by the usual Youtube premiere countdown shortly before the appointed start time).\n\nThe fact that it was prerecorded may explain why https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 's other event this day (https://twitter.com/ddlovato/status/1317160743339388929) at 8:45 PM PST wasn't a conflict; alternatively, that event may have been prerecorded as well.

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/insider/UFO-reporting.html\n\n> Do We Believe in U.F.O.s? That’s the Wrong Question\n\n> Reporting on the Pentagon program that’s investigating unidentified flying objects is not about belief. It’s about a vigilant search for facts.\n\n> The U.S. Navy has officially published previously released videos showing unexplained objects.\n\n> Numerous associates of the Pentagon program, with high security clearances and decades of involvement with official U.F.O. investigations, told us they were convinced such crashes have occurred, based on their access to classified information.\n\n> We were part of The New York Times’s team (with the Washington correspondent Helene Cooper) that broke the story of the Pentagon’s long-secret unit investigating unidentified flying objects, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, in December 2017.\n\n> Since then, we have reported on Navy pilots’ close encounters with U.F.O.s, and last week, on the current revamped program, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force and its official briefings — ongoing for more than a decade — for intelligence officials, aerospace executives and Congressional staff on reported U.F.O. crashes and retrieved materials.\n\n> We’re often asked by well-meaning associates and readers, “Do you believe in U.F.O.s?” The question sets us aback as being inappropriately personal. Times reporters are particularly averse to revealing opinions that could imply possible reporting bias.\n\n> But in this case we have no problem responding, “No, we don’t believe in U.F.O.s.”\n\n> As we see it, their existence, or nonexistence, is not a matter of belief.\n\n> We admire what the great anthropologist Margaret Mead said when asked long ago whether she believed in U.F.O.s. She called it “a silly question,” writing in Redbook in 1974:\n\n> > “Belief has to do with matters of faith; it has nothing to do with the kind of knowledge that is based on scientific inquiry. … Do people believe in the sun or the moon, or the changing seasons, or the chairs they’re sitting on? When we want to understand something strange, something previously unknown to anyone, we have to begin with an entirely different set of questions. What is it? How does it work?”\n\n> That’s what the Pentagon U.F.O. program has been focusing on, making it eminently newsworthy. And to be clear: U.F.O.s don’t mean aliens. Unidentified means we don’t know what they are, only that they demonstrate capabilities that do not appear to be possible through currently available technology.\n\n> In our reporting, we’ve focused on how the Department of Defense, the Office of Naval Intelligence and members of two Senate committees are engaged with this topic. Current officials are now concerned about the potential threat represented by the very real, advanced technological objects: how close they can come to our fighter jets, sometimes causing a near miss, and the risk that our adversaries may acquire the technology demonstrated by the objects before we do.\n\n> So if U.F.O.s are no longer a matter of belief, what are they and how do they do what they do?\n\n> And if technology has been retrieved from downed objects, what better way to try to understand how they work?\n\n> Our previous stories were relatively easy to document with Department of Defense videos of U.F.O.s and pilot eyewitness accounts backed up by Navy hazard reports of close encounters with small speeding objects.\n\n> Numerous associates of the Pentagon program, with high security clearances and decades of involvement with official U.F.O. investigations, told us they were convinced such crashes have occurred, based on their access to classified information. But the retrieved materials themselves, and any data about them, are completely off-limits to anyone without clearances and a need to know.\n\n> https://i.gyazo.com/555764e8cdeb1679f1ea0b25cb261efe.png\n\n> The Pentagon’s U.F.O. Program has been using unclassified slides like this to brief government officials on threats from Advanced Aerospace Vehicles — “including off-world” — and materials retrieved from crashes of unidentified phenomena.\n\n> We were provided a series of unclassified slides showing that the program took this seriously enough to include it in numerous briefings. One slide says one of the program’s tasks was to “arrange for access to data/reports/materials from crash retrievals of A.A.V.’s,” or advanced aerospace vehicles.\n\n> Our sources told us that “A.A.V.” does not refer to vehicles made in any country — not Russian or Chinese — but is used to mean technology in the realm of the truly unexplained. They also assure us that their briefings are based on facts, not belief.\n\nOn 2020/08/01, Christopher Mellon was interviewed on CNN about the \"off-world\" quote from Eric Davis:\n▶️

Unit Will Make Some Findings Public\n\n> For over a decade, the program, now tucked inside the Office of Naval Intelligence, has discussed mysterious events in classified briefings.\n\n> The U.S. Navy has officially published previously released videos showing unexplained objects.\n\n> Despite Pentagon statements that it disbanded a once-covert program to investigate unidentified flying objects, the effort remains underway — renamed and tucked inside the Office of Naval Intelligence, where officials continue to study mystifying encounters between military pilots and unidentified aerial vehicles.\n\n> Pentagon officials will not discuss the program, which is not classified but deals with classified matters. Yet it appeared last month in a Senate committee report outlining spending on the nation’s intelligence agencies for the coming year. The report said the program, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force, was “to standardize collection and reporting” on sightings of unexplained aerial vehicles, and was to report at least some of its findings to the public within 180 days after passage of the intelligence authorization act.\n\n> While retired officials involved with the effort — including Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader — hope the program will seek evidence of vehicles from other worlds, its main focus is on discovering whether another nation, especially any potential adversary, is using breakout aviation technology that could threaten the United States.\n\n> Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who is the acting chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told a CBS affiliate in Miami this month that he was primarily concerned about reports of unidentified aircraft over American military bases — and that it was in the government’s interest to find out who was responsible.\n\n> He expressed concerns that China or Russia or some other adversary had made “some technological leap” that “allows them to conduct this sort of activity.”\n\n> Mr. Rubio said some of the unidentified aerial vehicles over U.S. bases possibly exhibited technologies not in the American arsenal. But he also noted: “Maybe there is a completely, sort of, boring explanation for it. But we need to find out.”\n\n> In 2017, The New York Times disclosed the existence of a predecessor unit, called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program. Defense Department officials said at the time that the unit and its $22 million in funding had lapsed after 2012.\n\n> People working with the program, however, said it was still in operation in 2017 and beyond, statements later confirmed by the Defense Department.\n\n> The program was begun in 2007 under the Defense Intelligence Agency and was then placed within the office of the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, which remains responsible for its oversight. But its coordination with the intelligence community will be carried out by the Office of Naval Intelligence, as described in the Senate budget bill. The program never lapsed in those years, but little was disclosed about the post-2017 operations.\n\n> The Pentagon program’s previous director, Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence official who resigned in October 2017 after 10 years with the program, confirmed that the new task force evolved from the advanced aerospace program.\n\n> Luis Elizondo, a former military intelligence official, was the director of the Pentagon’s previous program on unidentified aerial vehicles.\n\n> “It no longer has to hide in the shadows,” Mr. Elizondo said. “It will have a new transparency.”\n\n> Mr. Elizondo is among a small group of former government officials and scientists with security clearances who, without presenting physical proof, say they are convinced that objects of undetermined origin have crashed on earth with materials retrieved for study.\n\n> For more than a decade, the Pentagon program has been conducting classified briefings for congressional committees, aerospace company executives and other government officials, according to interviews with program participants and unclassified briefing documents.\n\n> In some cases, earthly explanations have been found for previously unexplained incidents. Even lacking a plausible terrestrial explanation does not make an extraterrestrial one the most likely, astrophysicists say.\n\n> Mr. Reid, the former Democratic senator from Nevada who pushed for funding the earlier U.F.O. program when he was the majority leader, said he believed that crashes of objects of unknown origin may have occurred and that retrieved materials should be studied.\n\n> “After looking into this, I came to the conclusion that there were reports — some were substantive, some not so substantive — that there were actual materials that the government and the private sector had in their possession,” Mr. Reid said in an interview.\n\n> No crash artifacts have been publicly produced for independent verification. Some retrieved objects, such as unusual metallic fragments, were later identified from laboratory studies as man-made.\n\n> Eric W. Davis, an astrophysicist who worked as a subcontractor and then a consultant for the Pentagon U.F.O. program since 2007, said that, in some cases, examination of the materials had so far failed to determine their source and led him to conclude, “We couldn’t make it ourselves.”\n\n> The constraints on discussing classified programs — and the ambiguity of information cited in unclassified slides from the briefings — have put officials who have studied U.F.O.s in the position of stating their views without presenting any hard evidence.\n\n> Mr. Davis, who now works for Aerospace Corporation, a defense contractor, said he gave a classified briefing to a Defense Department agency as recently as March about retrievals from “off-world vehicles not made on this earth.”\n\n> Mr. Davis said he also gave classified briefings on retrievals of unexplained objects to staff members of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Oct. 21, 2019, and to staff members of the Senate Intelligence Committee two days later.\n\n> Committee staff members did not respond to requests for comment on the issue.\n\n> Public fascination with the topic of U.F.O.s has drawn in President Trump, who told his son Donald Trump Jr. in a June interview that he knew “very interesting” things about Roswell — a city in New Mexico that is central to speculation about the existence of U.F.O.s. The president demurred when asked if he would declassify any information on Roswell. “I’ll have to think about that one,” he said.\n\n> Either way, Mr. Reid said, more should be made public to clarify what is known and what is not. “It is extremely important that information about the discovery of physical materials or retrieved craft come out,” he said.\n\nOn 2020/07/25, https://trello.com/c/6or6lUGc/1884-%F0%9F%95%B8%EF%B8%8F-jay-anderson-project-unity held the first interview with the two journalists about their article:\nhttps://trello.com/c/cCDPYWl9/1862-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-jays-interview-with-ralph-blumenthal-leslie-kean-on-their-nyt-article\n\nThe article features a particularly powerful quote from Eric Davis, about \"off-world vehicles not made on this earth\".\n\nAnthony Garreffa reported on the article, headlining the Eric Davis \"off-world\" quote, here:\n📰 https://www.tweaktown.com/news/74016/pentagon-on-ufos-they-are-off-world-vehicles-not-made-this-earth/index.html\nThis is the report in the attached image.\n\nThe text message screenshot (in the attached image) is a conversation between Bob Lazar and Jeremy Corbell:\n📸 https://www.instagram.com/p/CDDD_GLpuWN/\nHere is Bob's own Instagram post about the news:\n📸 https://www.instagram.com/p/CDJ4_9xMWUA/\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/WXKYPWv2/1888-%F0%9F%93%93-leslie-kean & Ralph Blumenthal also wrote a followup article for the New York Times:\n📰 https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/insider/UFO-reporting.html\n\n> Do We Believe in U.F.O.s?

That’s the Wrong Question\n\n> Reporting on the Pentagon program that’s investigating unidentified flying objects is not about belief. It’s about a vigilant search for facts.\n\n> The U.S. Navy has officially published previously released videos showing unexplained objects.\n\n> Numerous associates of the Pentagon program, with high security clearances and decades of involvement with official U.F.O. investigations, told us they were convinced such crashes have occurred, based on their access to classified information.\n\n> We were part of The New York Times’s team (with the Washington correspondent Helene Cooper) that broke the story of the Pentagon’s long-secret unit investigating unidentified flying objects, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, in December 2017.\n\n> Since then, we have reported on Navy pilots’ close encounters with U.F.O.s, and last week, on the current revamped program, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force and its official briefings — ongoing for more than a decade — for intelligence officials, aerospace executives and Congressional staff on reported U.F.O. crashes and retrieved materials.\n\n> We’re often asked by well-meaning associates and readers, “Do you believe in U.F.O.s?” The question sets us aback as being inappropriately personal. Times reporters are particularly averse to revealing opinions that could imply possible reporting bias.\n\n> But in this case we have no problem responding, “No, we don’t believe in U.F.O.s.”\n\n> As we see it, their existence, or nonexistence, is not a matter of belief.\n\n> We admire what the great anthropologist Margaret Mead said when asked long ago whether she believed in U.F.O.s. She called it “a silly question,” writing in Redbook in 1974:\n\n> > “Belief has to do with matters of faith; it has nothing to do with the kind of knowledge that is based on scientific inquiry. … Do people believe in the sun or the moon, or the changing seasons, or the chairs they’re sitting on? When we want to understand something strange, something previously unknown to anyone, we have to begin with an entirely different set of questions. What is it? How does it work?”\n\n> That’s what the Pentagon U.F.O. program has been focusing on, making it eminently newsworthy. And to be clear: U.F.O.s don’t mean aliens. Unidentified means we don’t know what they are, only that they demonstrate capabilities that do not appear to be possible through currently available technology.\n\n> In our reporting, we’ve focused on how the Department of Defense, the Office of Naval Intelligence and members of two Senate committees are engaged with this topic. Current officials are now concerned about the potential threat represented by the very real, advanced technological objects: how close they can come to our fighter jets, sometimes causing a near miss, and the risk that our adversaries may acquire the technology demonstrated by the objects before we do.\n\n> So if U.F.O.s are no longer a matter of belief, what are they and how do they do what they do?\n\n> And if technology has been retrieved from downed objects, what better way to try to understand how they work?\n\n> Our previous stories were relatively easy to document with Department of Defense videos of U.F.O.s and pilot eyewitness accounts backed up by Navy hazard reports of close encounters with small speeding objects.\n\n> Numerous associates of the Pentagon program, with high security clearances and decades of involvement with official U.F.O. investigations, told us they were convinced such crashes have occurred, based on their access to classified information. But the retrieved materials themselves, and any data about them, are completely off-limits to anyone without clearances and a need to know.\n\n> https://i.gyazo.com/555764e8cdeb1679f1ea0b25cb261efe.png\n\n> The Pentagon’s U.F.O.

Including shocking testimony from high-ranking government and military officials, NASA Astronauts, other credible sources, and riveting never-before seen footage, the timely film also reveals the monumental events behind the NY Times’ recent bombshell disclosure of The Pentagon’s secret UFO Program, and provides eye-opening evidence that mankind is not alone in the universe.\n> Senator Harry Reid calls it “Meritorious.  It makes the incredible credible.\" Former Senior CIA Officer Jim Semivan, calls it “The most important documentary of the year.” Dr. Jacques Vallee says “70 years of secrecy has led to this. The most credible documentary ever made about UFOs.”  George Knapp calls it, “A definitive examination of an enduring global mystery. This film will land on an unsuspecting Earth with the force of an alien invasion.\"\n> Narrated by Peter Coyote, the film includes Senator Harry Reid, President Clinton, John Podesta, White House Chief of Staff for Clinton and advisor to Obama, Governor Bill Richardson, former U.S Department of Defense Senior Intelligence Official, Christopher Mellon, NASA Astronauts, Governor Fife Symington, and Dr. Jacques Vallee, who was portrayed in Steven Spielberg’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\n> \"The Phenomenon is meritorious. It makes the incredible credible.”  \n-Former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (Senator from Nevada, 1987-2017)\n> “The most important documentary of the year and the most accurate examination of the world's greatest mystery.”  - Jim Semivan, Former CIA officer, Senior Intelligence Service\n>  “The rapidly increasing number and quality of land and space-based sensors is making the UAP issue impossible to avoid. I can’t think of a better way for people to begin educating themselves on this long-neglected issue than watching “The Phenomenon.” The film provides a badly needed remedy for the unwarranted stigma that for too long has prevented government and academia from taking this important topic seriously.”\n- Chris Mellon, Former United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, U.S. Department of Defense\n> \"70 years of secrecy has led to this. The most credible documentary ever made about UFOs.” \n- Jacques Vallee, world renowned scientist and UFO researcher\n>  “A definitive examination of an enduring global mystery.

https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 did https://trello.com/c/0mjbV10S/2132-ce-5-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F.\n\nThis was a prerecorded Youtube video that\n📅 premiered on 20/10/16 at 7:30 PST\n🗺️ at Joshua Tree National Park, California, United States.\n\n📎 Around when the premiere happened, the two attached images containing photos of apparent recent sightings in the sky while with https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 were in https://trello.com/c/BFe9llWE/2083-%F0%9F%93%B8-dr-steven-greer 's Story.\n📸 A clip from the Youtube video was in his Story as well.\n\nVivian Kubrick (who Greer follows on https://trello.com/c/s6hIOqGX/1418-%F0%9F%90%A4-dr-steven-greer) Tweeted about this event:\nhttps://twitter.com/ViKu1111/status/1317298127284719618?s=19\n\n📸 The next day, https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 posted footage to Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CGb6T3HBtch/\n📅 20/10/17\n> The past few days I’ve spent in Joshua Tree with a small group of loved ones and @dr.steven.greer {https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F} and his CE5 {https://trello.com/c/0mjbV10S/2132-ce-5-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F} team. Over the past couple months I have dug deep into the science of consciousness and experienced not only peace and serenity like I’ve never known but I also have witnessed the most incredibly profound sightings both in the sky as well as feet away from me. This planet is on a very negative path towards destruction but WE can change that together. If we were to get 1% of the population to meditate and make contact, we would force our governments to acknowledge the truth about extraterrestrial life among us and change our destructive habits destroying our planet. This is just some of the evidence from under the stars in the desert sky that can no longer be ignored and must be shared immediately 💞💫☄️ to make contact yourself you can download the CE5 app {https://trello.com/c/3bVj6FWz/185-%F0%9F%93%B2-ce-5-contact-app} and it will teach you the protocols to connect to life form beyond our planet!! (Ps, if it doesn’t happen on the first try - keep trying - it took me several sessions to tap into a deep enough level of meditation to make contact!) Happy communicating 💞🙏🏼\n\n----\n\nOn prerecordedness and the schedule\n----------------\n\nThis was definitely prerecorded given that Youtube doesn't have a function to premiere a livestream, only an uploaded video file; and it was in fact a premiere (as made clear by the usual Youtube premiere countdown shortly before the appointed start time).\n\nThe fact that it was prerecorded may explain why https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 's other event this day (https://twitter.com/ddlovato/status/1317160743339388929) at 8:45 PM PST wasn't a conflict; alternatively, that event may have been prerecorded as well. That seems likely, in which case https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 was at Joshua Tree for likely all of 20/10/16.\n\nIt's also apparent that https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 was there for at least the evening and later on 20/10/15, given the text overlayed onto the sighting photos in those two attached sighting photo images, and that there was the (failed) attempt at a livestream that day.\nAccording to Greer's team, Greer was with Demi since 20/10/13 at Joshua Tree. They tried to go live several times, but \"at the house there was virtually no internet\" and Demi's people weren't okay with her being livestreamed (they \"must review and approve any content she puts out\"). There were other \"VIP/Celeb\" folks there who also did not want to be live.\n\nSupposedly the plan they came up with was to make contact for 5 nights in a row.\n\nKnown CSETI team members (names withheld) flew to Joshua Tree to participate in this event with https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F and https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4.\n\n----\n\nThis was preceded by https://trello.com/c/u5rLBLKk/2796-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-greers-announcement-of-livestreamed-meditation-with-demi-lovato.\n\nNext came the news coverage:\nhttps://trello.com/c/PsOe011y/2831-%F0%9F%97%9E%EF%B8%8F-demi-lovato-dr-greer-doing-ce-5-at-joshua-tree\n\n----\n\nCheck out more about https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F."},"card":{"desc":"Failed initial livestream\n----------------\n\n▶️ https://youtu.be/fhYFJtCKr6I\n\n📅 20/10/15\n\nInterestingly, this same night, https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 's 'Commander In Chief' music video –\n▶️ https://youtu.be/n9Y-lS1trhw\n– was the #2 trending video worldwide on Youtube:\nhttps://i.gyazo.com/73344a7c5402e1321631f8a26c61b731.png\n\n----\n\nYoutube premiere and social media activity\n----------------\n\n▶️ https://youtu.be/ZCHcJ_CBnzs\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F and https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 did https://trello.com/c/0mjbV10S/2132-ce-5-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F.\n\nThis was a prerecorded Youtube video that\n📅 premiered on 20/10/16 at 7:30 PST\n🗺️ at Joshua Tree National Park, California, United States.\n\n📎 Around when the premiere happened, the two attached images containing photos of apparent recent sightings in the sky while with https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 were in https://trello.com/c/BFe9llWE/2083-%F0%9F%93%B8-dr-steven-greer 's Story.\n📸 A clip from the Youtube video was in his Story as well.\n\nVivian Kubrick (who Greer follows on https://trello.com/c/s6hIOqGX/1418-%F0%9F%90%A4-dr-steven-greer) Tweeted about this event:\nhttps://twitter.com/ViKu1111/status/1317298127284719618?s=19\n\n📸 The next day, https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 posted footage to Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CGb6T3HBtch/\n📅 20/10/17\n> The past few days I’ve spent in Joshua Tree with a small group of loved ones and @dr.steven.greer {https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F} and his CE5 {https://trello.com/c/0mjbV10S/2132-ce-5-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F} team.

team. Over the past couple months I have dug deep into the science of consciousness and experienced not only peace and serenity like I’ve never known but I also have witnessed the most incredibly profound sightings both in the sky as well as feet away from me. This planet is on a very negative path towards destruction but WE can change that together. If we were to get 1% of the population to meditate and make contact, we would force our governments to acknowledge the truth about extraterrestrial life among us and change our destructive habits destroying our planet. This is just some of the evidence from under the stars in the desert sky that can no longer be ignored and must be shared immediately 💞💫☄️ to make contact yourself you can download the CE5 app {https://trello.com/c/3bVj6FWz/185-%F0%9F%93%B2-ce-5-contact-app} and it will teach you the protocols to connect to life form beyond our planet!!

They tried to go live several times, but \"at the house there was virtually no internet\" and Demi's people weren't okay with her being livestreamed (they \"must review and approve any content she puts out\").

Over the past couple months I have dug deep into the science of consciousness and experienced not only peace and serenity like I’ve never known but I also have witnessed the most incredibly profound sightings both in the sky as well as feet away from me. This planet is on a very negative path towards destruction but WE can change that together. If we were to get 1% of the population to meditate and make contact, we would force our governments to acknowledge the truth about extraterrestrial life among us and change our destructive habits destroying our planet. This is just some of the evidence from under the stars in the desert sky that can no longer be ignored and must be shared immediately 💞💫☄️ to make contact yourself you can download the CE5 app {https://trello.com/c/3bVj6FWz/185-%F0%9F%93%B2-ce-5-contact-app} and it will teach you the protocols to connect to life form beyond our planet!! (Ps, if it doesn’t happen on the first try - keep trying - it took me several sessions to tap into a deep enough level of meditation to make contact!) Happy communicating 💞🙏🏼\n\n----\n\nOn prerecordedness and the schedule\n----------------\n\nThis was definitely prerecorded given that Youtube doesn't have a function to premiere a livestream, only an uploaded video file; and it was in fact a premiere (as made clear by the usual Youtube premiere countdown shortly before the appointed start time).\n\nThe fact that it was prerecorded may explain why https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 's other event this day (https://twitter.com/ddlovato/status/1317160743339388929) at 8:45 PM PST wasn't a conflict; alternatively, that event may have been prerecorded as well.

Happy communicating 💞🙏🏼\n\n----\n\nOn prerecordedness and the schedule\n----------------\n\nThis was definitely prerecorded given that Youtube doesn't have a function to premiere a livestream, only an uploaded video file; and it was in fact a premiere (as made clear by the usual Youtube premiere countdown shortly before the appointed start time).\n\nThe fact that it was prerecorded may explain why https://trello.com/c/aG9LsKs8/2091-%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8E%A4-demi-lovato-%F0%9F%8E%A4 's other event this day (https://twitter.com/ddlovato/status/1317160743339388929) at 8:45 PM PST wasn't a conflict; alternatively, that event may have been prerecorded as well.

They tried to go live several times, but \"at the house there was virtually no internet\" and Demi's people weren't okay with her being livestreamed (they \"must review and approve any content she puts out\"). There were other \"VIP/Celeb\" folks there who also did not want to be live.\n\nSupposedly the plan they came up with was to make contact for 5 nights in a row.\n\nKnown CSETI team members (names

Oliver's Lemurians lived in a complex of tunnels beneath the mountain and occasionally were seen walking the surface dressed in white robes. In 1931, Harvey Spencer Lewis, using the pseudonym Wisar Spenle Cerve, wrote a book (published by the Rosicrucians) about the hidden Lemurians of https://trello.com/c/Qr1sZx9r/1757-%F0%9F%8F%94%EF%B8%8F-mount-shasta that a bibliography on https://trello.com/c/Qr1sZx9r/1757-%F0%9F%8F%94%EF%B8%8F-mount-shasta described as \"responsible for the legend's widespread popularity.\" This belief has been incorporated into numerous occult religions, including \"I AM\" Activity, The Summit Lighthouse, Church Universal and Triumphant, and Kryon.\n\n> According to Guy Ballard, while hiking on https://trello.com/c/Qr1sZx9r/1757-%F0%9F%8F%94%EF%B8%8F-mount-shasta, he encountered a man who introduced himself as Count of St. Germain, who is said to have started Ballard on the path to discovering the teachings that would become the \"I AM\" Activity religious movement.\n\n> According to a legend, J. C. Brown was a British prospector who discovered a lost underground city beneath https://trello.com/c/Qr1sZx9r/1757-%F0%9F%8F%94%EF%B8%8F-mount-shasta in 1904. Brown had been hired by the Lord Cowdray Mining Company of England to prospect for gold, and discovered a cave which sloped downward for 11 miles. In the cave, he found an underground village filled with gold, shields, and mummies, some being up to 10 feet tall.\n\n> Thirty years later, he told his story to John C. Root, who proceeded to gather an exploration team in Stockton, California. About 80 people joined the team, but on the day the team was to set out, Brown did not show up. Brown was not heard from again.\n\n----\n\nCheck out more on https://trello.com/c/Qr1sZx9r/1757-%F0%9F%8F%94%EF%B8%8F-mount-shasta."},"card":{"desc":"🧩 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legends_of_Mount_Shasta\n> California's https://trello.com/c/Qr1sZx9r/1757-%F0%9F%8F%94%EF%B8%8F-mount-shasta has been the subject of an unusually large number of myths and legends.

satellite flashing intervals:**\n\n• This site offers a range of possible flashing intervals:\n🌐 https://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/9:\n> Each of the tumblers has its own characteristic flashing pattern - some with a period of only 1 seconds, where others flash every 40 seconds.\n\n• This site recounts a short tumbling satellite flashing interval:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/tumble/tumbleintro.html:\nIt is recorded that one tumbling satellite had a flash period of only 2.18 seconds.\n\n----\n\n📅 **Tumbling satellite predictions:**\n\n• https://trello.com/c/JZc2Fdzh/2611-%F0%9F%92%BB-stellarium-%F0%9F%A4%A9 is worth checking out; it is probably the most comprehensive and useful reference.\n\n• The following site allows entry of latitude, longitude, and date to apparently return a list of possible tumbling satellite sightings and key info such as their expected magnitudes and their appearance and disappearance times, allowing quick deduction as to whether a possible tumbling satellite sighting was predicted.\n🌐 https://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/9\n> The prediction of satellite flares is only possible in case the satellite is still controlled. There are many satellites, that are out of control and cannot be used for flare predictions. Hence it happens by accident, that the mirroring panels are in the right geometry with you and still produce a show. Actually, this presentation is even more striking, since it may consist of a periodic series of dazzling flashes. Inbetween, you can track the satellite with binoculars. CalSky predicts the opportunities of the show of many tumbling satellites.\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *Geosynchronous (& geostationary) satellites*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n❔ **About geosynchronous satellites:**\n\nA 'geosynchronous' satellite is one having a period of rotation synchronous with that of the Earth's rotation. This means that if the Earth has rotated, say, exactly 67 times, the satellite will have rotated exactly 67 times as well.\nSuch a satellite may orbit the Earth at any angle; this could be along the equator, from pole to pole, etc.\nTo say that a satellite is geosynchronous thus is like saying that it makes a rotation in the same rhythm that the Earth makes a rotation (regardless of which direction it makes that rotation in). If the Earth and the satellite were to both play a note of music every time they complete one orbit, then they would be playing notes at the same frequency.\n\n----\n\n❔ **About geostationary satellites:**\n\nIf a geosynchronous satellite is also rotating so that it follows above a certain location on the Earth (as if locked to that location by a long, straight rod: http://skyandtelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/Geosynchronous_orbit-wiki.gif), then it is called 'geostationary', in addition to being geosynchronous. (All geostationary satellites are geosynchronous.)\n\nThese satellites are often referred to as \"geosats\", for short, or even \"geos\".\n\n----\n\n💻 **Simulation:**\n\nScott Manley demonstrates the terms 'geostationary' and 'geosynchronous' with a simulation of satellites around the Earth, using Universe Sandbox 2, at the following timestamp (until 9:11):\n▶️ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZAkiXNJIqc&t=360\nHe first demonstrates geostationary orbit, then changes the satellite simulation to no longer have a geostationary orbit, but still a geosynchronous one. This helps to visualize the geostationary distinction of geosynchronous satellites.\n\n----\n\n📹 **Geostationary satellite example footage:**\n\n'Geostationary & Medium Earth Orbit Night vision satellite & UFO Hunting'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/2CM3N4RXLTg\n\n'Flares of Geostationary Satellites'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/_wmrZPU9jcg\n\n'Geo Flasher'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/DDuX3BxKo08\n\n'GEO flares 24 09 14'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/yCfOvGidP5A\n\n'Galaxy 26 - dead geostationary satellite flashes'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/bgrgujPc6JM\n\n----\n\n📷 **Geostationary satellite example photos:**\n\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/\n\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n\n----\n\n**🔬 Example geostationary satellite determinations:**\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn (on https://trello.com/b/SfOqk4j7/published-sighting-analyses)\n\n----\n\n💥 **Geostationary satellite flashing appearance:**\n\n• While the term flashing is often used to describe the brightening of geostationary satellites, 'flaring' seems more appropriate, based on the example footage. The example footage is more reminiscent of iridium flares \"flaring\" (like \"powering up\" gradually).\n\n• This site describes geosynchronous satellites as potentially \"flaring\", not \"flashing\":\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n> If you make a point to look for geosats shortly before they enter or shortly after they leave the shadow, you might catch a flare, some of which are bright enough to see in binoculars and rarely, with the naked eye.\n\n• The following case exhibits what is best described as \"flashing\", but was later confirmed to be a geostationary satellite:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n🌟 **Geostationary satellite brightness magnitudes:**\n\n• Anywhere from 14th to 5th magnitude is typical. A quite bright outlier at 3rd magnitude has been reported.\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html:\n> Typically the satellite will be in the mag. +11 to +14 range (or dimmer), but brightening by several magnitudes when the geometry is favourable (around mag. +5 to +6 is not untypical). One satellite is reported to have briefly been visible to the naked eye at mag. +3 !\n\n• A flash as bright as 1st magnitude is possible.\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/:\n> Some satellites at this high altitude will flash to naked eye brightness. As an example here is Telstar 401 which was recorded 11/26/00. It flashed up to +1 magnitude though some of its flashes were not quite naked eye brightness.\n\n• The following case exhibits a magnitude around 1.19, the magnitude of Saturn (which was nearby):\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n• However, it's rare to catch a flare of a geostationary satellite with the naked eye.\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n> If you make a point to look for geosats shortly before they enter or shortly after they leave the shadow, you might catch a flare, some of which are bright enough to see in binoculars and rarely, with the naked eye.\n\n----\n\n⌚ **Geostationary satellite flashing intervals:**\n\n• Of the example footage found, the most frequent interval between flashes was about 10 seconds.\n\n• A common interval is usually 15-45 seconds between flashes. For instance, one data point records a 38 second flash period:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html\n\n• However, they have at least been known to flash as often as 5 seconds;\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/:\n> Sometimes the big flash was preceded by another smaller one 5 seconds before hand. Here is the first faint flash.\n...\n> The next image shows the much more distinct and brighter, 3rd magnitude flash which occurred 5 seconds later.\n\n• The following case exhibits a flashing interval of just over 3 seconds:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n☀️ **Geostationary satellite equinox relationship:**\n\n• This site describes the significance of equinoxes with regard to geostationary satellites:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html\n> Unlike objects in low Earth orbit, geostationary satellites are visible throughout every night of the year, only entering the Earth's shadow for up to 70 minutes per day, around a couple of weeks either side of each equinox. During the same period the satellite tends to brighten over several days, twice a year, when the satellites orientation favors the 'beaming' of the Sun in the direction of the observer.\n...\n> As pointed out above it is more rewarding to carry this out around the Spring and Fall equinoxes when the satellite will be more apparent. Observations over successive nights before and after this time will allow you to view the brightening of the object, plus its entry and exit from the Earth's shadow. Of course this will also avoid the disappointment of searching for it whilst it is in eclipse!\n\n• The following case took place 10 days before the 2020 autumnal equinox:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n📅 **Geostationary satellite predictions:**\n\n• https://trello.com/c/JZc2Fdzh/2611-%F0%9F%92%BB-stellarium-%F0%9F%A4%A9 can include geostationary satellites, perhaps the most of any reference.\n\n• The following site allows entry of latitude, longitude, and date to apparently return a list of possible geostationary satellite sightings and key info such as their expected magnitudes and their astrological location, allowing quick deduction as to whether a possible geostationary satellite sighting was predicted.\n🌐https://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/10\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *Secret/spy satellites*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n❔ **Some background:**\n\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/spy-satellites/\n\n----\n\n----\n\nCheck out further https://trello.com/c/NRW3PmdB/2066-%F0%9F%94%AD-skywatching-reference."},"card":{"desc":"https://trello.com/c/JZc2Fdzh/2611-%F0%9F%92%BB-stellarium-%F0%9F%A4%A9\n----------------\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *SpaceX Starlink*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n📹 **Example footage:**\n▶️ https://youtu.be/vkZpusxb0iM\n\n----\n\n❔ **About:**\nStarlink is a satellite constellation from SpaceX that provides internet access around the world.\nThese satellites often appear in an obvious sequence, almost like traincars.\n🧩 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *Iridium satellite flares*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n📹 **Example footage:**\n▶️ https://youtu.be/MTGVuPr9Epg\n\n----\n\n📷 **Example photos:**\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/iridium-satellites/\n\n----\n\n❔ **About:**\n🧩 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_flare#Iridium_flares\nBe sure to distinguish https://trello.com/c/43Es08Gs/2801-powerups-%F0%9F%92%A1 from iridium flares.\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *Tumbling satellites*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n📹 **Example footage:**\n\n'Chinese reconnaissance satellite Yaogan 6 tumbling and flashing'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/i8hAq51nYXY\n\n'JAXA Satellite's Out-Of-Control Tumble Captured By Amateur Astronomer'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/ZkHAJYp_q3A\n\n'Oct 30 2014 0406 Satellite Flashing Near Betelgeuse'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/lewotn8QMC4\n\n'tumbling satellite 22-07-15'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/VgqHKIiYRoM\n\n'Night vision, tumbling satellite.'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/-nMR_V7ZI4I\n\n----\n\n❔ **About:**\n\n• This site offers a detailed introduction to tumbling satellites:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/tumble/tumbleintro.html\n\n----\n\n⌚ **Tumbling satellite flashing intervals:**\n\n• This site offers a range of possible flashing intervals:\n🌐 https://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/9:\n> Each of the tumblers has its own characteristic flashing pattern - some with a period of only 1 seconds, where others flash every 40 seconds.\n\n• This site recounts a short tumbling satellite flashing interval:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/tumble/tumbleintro.html:\nIt is recorded that one tumbling satellite had a flash period of only 2.18 seconds.\n\n----\n\n📅 **Tumbling satellite predictions:**\n\n• https://trello.com/c/JZc2Fdzh/2611-%F0%9F%92%BB-stellarium-%F0%9F%A4%A9 is worth checking out; it is probably the most comprehensive and useful reference.\n\n• The following site allows entry of latitude, longitude, and date to apparently return a list of possible tumbling satellite sightings and key info such as their expected magnitudes and their appearance and disappearance times, allowing quick deduction as to whether a possible tumbling satellite sighting was predicted.\n🌐 https://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/9\n> The prediction of satellite flares is only possible in case the satellite is still controlled.

If the Earth and the satellite were to both play a note of music every time they complete one orbit, then they would be playing notes at the same frequency.\n\n----\n\n❔ **About geostationary satellites:**\n\nIf a geosynchronous satellite is also rotating so that it follows above a certain location on the Earth (as if locked to that location by a long, straight rod: http://skyandtelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/Geosynchronous_orbit-wiki.gif), then it is called 'geostationary', in addition to being geosynchronous. (All geostationary satellites are geosynchronous.)\n\nThese satellites are often referred to as \"geosats\", for short, or even \"geos\".\n\n----\n\n💻 **Simulation:**\n\nScott Manley demonstrates the terms 'geostationary' and 'geosynchronous' with a simulation of satellites around the Earth, using Universe Sandbox 2, at the following timestamp (until 9:11):\n▶️ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZAkiXNJIqc&t=360\nHe first demonstrates geostationary orbit, then changes the satellite simulation to no longer have a geostationary orbit, but still a geosynchronous one. This helps to visualize the geostationary distinction of geosynchronous satellites.\n\n----\n\n📹 **Geostationary satellite example footage:**\n\n'Geostationary & Medium Earth Orbit Night vision satellite & UFO Hunting'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/2CM3N4RXLTg\n\n'Flares of Geostationary Satellites'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/_wmrZPU9jcg\n\n'Geo Flasher'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/DDuX3BxKo08\n\n'GEO flares 24 09 14'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/yCfOvGidP5A\n\n'Galaxy 26 - dead geostationary satellite flashes'\n▶️ https://youtu.be/bgrgujPc6JM\n\n----\n\n📷 **Geostationary satellite example photos:**\n\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/\n\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n\n----\n\n**🔬 Example geostationary satellite determinations:**\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn (on https://trello.com/b/SfOqk4j7/published-sighting-analyses)\n\n----\n\n💥 **Geostationary satellite flashing appearance:**\n\n• While the term flashing is often used to describe the brightening of geostationary satellites, 'flaring' seems more appropriate, based on the example footage. The example footage is more reminiscent of iridium flares \"flaring\" (like \"powering up\" gradually).\n\n• This site describes geosynchronous satellites as potentially \"flaring\", not \"flashing\":\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n> If you make a point to look for geosats shortly before they enter or shortly after they leave the shadow, you might catch a flare, some of which are bright enough to see in binoculars and rarely, with the naked eye.\n\n• The following case exhibits what is best described as \"flashing\", but was later confirmed to be a geostationary satellite:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n🌟 **Geostationary satellite brightness magnitudes:**\n\n• Anywhere from 14th to 5th magnitude is typical. A quite bright outlier at 3rd magnitude has been reported.\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html:\n> Typically the satellite will be in the mag. +11 to +14 range (or dimmer), but brightening by several magnitudes when the geometry is favourable (around mag. +5 to +6 is not untypical). One satellite is reported to have briefly been visible to the naked eye at mag. +3 !\n\n• A flash as bright as 1st magnitude is possible.\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/:\n> Some satellites at this high altitude will flash to naked eye brightness. As an example here is Telstar 401 which was recorded 11/26/00. It flashed up to +1 magnitude though some of its flashes were not quite naked eye brightness.\n\n• The following case exhibits a magnitude around 1.19, the magnitude of Saturn (which was nearby):\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n• However, it's rare to catch a flare of a geostationary satellite with the naked eye.\n🌐 https://skyandtelescope.org/observing/how-to-see-and-photograph-geosynchronous-satellites/\n> If you make a point to look for geosats shortly before they enter or shortly after they leave the shadow, you might catch a flare, some of which are bright enough to see in binoculars and rarely, with the naked eye.\n\n----\n\n⌚ **Geostationary satellite flashing intervals:**\n\n• Of the example footage found, the most frequent interval between flashes was about 10 seconds.\n\n• A common interval is usually 15-45 seconds between flashes. For instance, one data point records a 38 second flash period:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html\n\n• However, they have at least been known to flash as often as 5 seconds;\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/geostationary-satellites/:\n> Sometimes the big flash was preceded by another smaller one 5 seconds before hand. Here is the first faint flash.\n...\n> The next image shows the much more distinct and brighter, 3rd magnitude flash which occurred 5 seconds later.\n\n• The following case exhibits a flashing interval of just over 3 seconds:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n☀️ **Geostationary satellite equinox relationship:**\n\n• This site describes the significance of equinoxes with regard to geostationary satellites:\n🌐 http://www.satobs.org/geosats.html\n> Unlike objects in low Earth orbit, geostationary satellites are visible throughout every night of the year, only entering the Earth's shadow for up to 70 minutes per day, around a couple of weeks either side of each equinox. During the same period the satellite tends to brighten over several days, twice a year, when the satellites orientation favors the 'beaming' of the Sun in the direction of the observer.\n...\n> As pointed out above it is more rewarding to carry this out around the Spring and Fall equinoxes when the satellite will be more apparent. Observations over successive nights before and after this time will allow you to view the brightening of the object, plus its entry and exit from the Earth's shadow. Of course this will also avoid the disappointment of searching for it whilst it is in eclipse!\n\n• The following case took place 10 days before the 2020 autumnal equinox:\nhttps://trello.com/c/jIPibIZU/3-20-09-12-stationary-flashing-every-3-seconds-triangular-to-jupiter-saturn\n\n----\n\n📅 **Geostationary satellite predictions:**\n\n• https://trello.com/c/JZc2Fdzh/2611-%F0%9F%92%BB-stellarium-%F0%9F%A4%A9 can include geostationary satellites, perhaps the most of any reference.\n\n• The following site allows entry of latitude, longitude, and date to apparently return a list of possible geostationary satellite sightings and key info such as their expected magnitudes and their astrological location, allowing quick deduction as to whether a possible geostationary satellite sighting was predicted.\n🌐https://www.calsky.com/cs.cgi/Satellites/10\n\n----\n\n----\n\n🛰️ *Secret/spy satellites*\n----------------\n\n----\n\n❔ **Some background:**\n\n🌐 https://eclipsetours.com/paul-maley/artificial-satellite-observations/spy-satellites/\n\n----\n\n----\n\nCheck out further https://trello.com/c/NRW3PmdB/2066-%F0%9F%94%AD-skywatching-reference.","id":"5f751a45115fa546e6b73267","name":"🛰️ Satellite reference guide","idShort":2578,"shortLink":"qfl0mZZG"},"board":{"id":"5ef6690730145a713865e369","name":"✨ Contact Compendium 💖","shortLink":"B9gQNp9h"},"list":{"id":"5f10b1637731887d2e5606ec","name":"🔭 Skywatching reference"}},"appCreator":null,"type":"updateCard","date":"2020-10-14T06:11:22.113Z","limits":null,"memberCreator":{"id":"5ba839acdb687d672de69a97","activityBlocked":false,"avatarHash":"c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5ba839acdb687d672de69a97/c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","fullName":"Felewin-Yang","idMemberReferrer":null,"initials":"F","nonPublic":{"fullName":"Hunter Bobeck","initials":"HB","avatarUrl":"https://trello-members.s3.amazonaws.com/5ba839acdb687d672de69a97/c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00","avatarHash":"c2df8343ebb46ff454baa1c62b9e1b00"},"nonPublicAvailable":true,"username":"felewin"}},{"id":"5f86966232331804e563de3d","idMemberCreator":"5ba839acdb687d672de69a97","data":{"old":{"desc":"▶️ https://youtu.be/C7DwVXQw6NM\n\nThis footage shows one of the most... organic https://trello.com/c/NJ7hKcR7/2238-powerups-%F0%9F%92%A1, making it quite a striking sighting, and is in apparent response to the infrared laser flashing.

classification system, extended\n----------------\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/xjBUrKmI/2435-%F0%9F%94%AD-dr-j-allen-hynek-%F0%9F%93%98 started the Close Encounters classification system.\n\n~'CE-#' stands for ~'close encounter of the #th' kind.\n\nA CE-1 involves a sighting of an ET craft.\nA CE-2 involves physical evidence of an ET craft.\nA CE-3 involves a sighting of an ET lifeform.\nA CE-4 involves an experiecne on-board an ET craft.\nhttps://trello.com/c/0mjbV10S/2132-ce-5-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F is human-initiated contact. This is basically the subject of this entire board.\n\nSee the relevant attached image for a summary of the first 5 classifications, from the https://trello.com/c/3bVj6FWz/185-%F0%9F%93%B2-ce-5-contact-app.\n\nWith https://trello.com/c/HzyK639B/337-the-harmonic-convergence-2020, Mark Sims /Tezjbar presented https://trello.com/c/EGsa2ABq/1441-the-ce-6-classification; the classification system was given an update with https://trello.com/c/CujmO8FS/1438-%E2%96%B6%EF%B8%8F-paul-hynek-establishing-a-new-classification-code-for-contact.\n\nHere is the explanation from the CE-5 documentary on types 1-5:\nhttps://youtu.be/CmwX467x6RM\n\n----\n\nhttps://trello.com/c/26tGfMRX/2134-hice-%F0%9F%96%96\n----------------\n\nAnother term, 'https://trello.com/c/26tGfMRX/2134-hice-%F0%9F%96%96', stands for Human-Initiated Contact Experience, and is synonymous with https://trello.com/c/0mjbV10S/2132-ce-5-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F, with the distinguishing factor of not being conceived by https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F nor being part of https://trello.com/c/xjBUrKmI/2435-%F0%9F%94%AD-dr-j-allen-hynek-%F0%9F%93%98 's extended classification system. Just like https://trello.com/c/0mjbV10S/2132-ce-5-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F, https://trello.com/c/26tGfMRX/2134-hice-%F0%9F%96%96 is basically the subject of this entire board.\n\nOf course, the term https://trello.com/c/0mjbV10S/2132-ce-5-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F itself has already extended beyond https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F 's original definition, as indicated by such work as https://trello.com/c/EcHLTK2l/265-a-ce-5-handbook – however, https://trello.com/c/26tGfMRX/2134-hice-%F0%9F%96%96 effectively precludes the possibility of https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F being involved, or of any context alongside https://trello.com/c/xjBUrKmI/2435-%F0%9F%94%AD-dr-j-allen-hynek-%F0%9F%93%98 's classification system.\n\nNot only does having less association reduce possible confusion and disinterest from those new to the subject, this term is effectively a broader term than https://trello.com/c/0mjbV10S/2132-ce-5-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F, for which the success of having such an experience is more immediately open to being achieved through any newer contact techniques/protocols by people other than https://trello.com/c/4dFMjJpF/2089-%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%9A%95%EF%B8%8F-dr-steven-greer-%F0%9F%A7%98%E2%99%82%EF%B8%8F, even any approaches not yet formalized. For instance, https://trello.com/c/LLFXfKM3/1582-%F0%9F%8C%8C-coherent-thought-sequencing is less implicit as part of the process; in fact, there is no defined process. The term was started by

Instead of necessarily vectoring to your specific location (although you can), think of the Earth itself making contact. Each human acts as a neuron in the consciousness of the Earth.
