    content: `A flashbulb is a brief, apparently round flash of incredibly bright light, usually occuring without any sound. Unlike camera flashes or other artificial lights, they have an otherworldly brilliance that is pure and beautiful. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SLdn1gET88&list=PLnrEt2fIdZ0baV2rjIp6mILJsUIbdgKf2&t=421s" target="_blank">The light comes from a source and materials that aren't manufacturable; the elements are so pure that even in the vacuum of space, our humans could not manufacture it.</a>`
