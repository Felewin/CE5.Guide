writes:\nüëç https://www.facebook.com/lori.williams.CRV1/posts/10220299997923022\n> Is CRV evil?  \nAs a former Christian missionary, I really considered the \"rightness\" or \"wrongness\" of CRV.  \nI used to teach Bible history.  Did you know the prophets of old weren't just born prophets?  They literally went to \"prophet school\" and learned how to obtain information from God.  \nOne thing that really helped me was to think about my God-given senses:  Eyesight, for example. Is it evil?  Of course not.  But ... what if it is used to view porn? Then is it evil?  No, not the eyesight, itself.  It is not evil.  Just as a gun is an inert piece of metal, until it is USED for evil.  \nOur psychic sense is simply another sense.  The Bible is full of examples of precognition, dreams, visions, etc.  The Bible is a very supernatural book!  In the Book of Joel it says, \"In the latter days, your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams.\"  This is happening.  \nCRV is simply a written process to help people separate true intuitive perception from just imagination.

She writes:\nüëç https://www.facebook.com/lori.williams.CRV1/posts/10220299997923022\n> Is CRV evil?  \nAs a former Christian missionary, I really considered the \"rightness\" or \"wrongness\" of CRV.  \nI used to teach Bible history.  Did you know the prophets of old weren't just born prophets?  They literally went to \"prophet school\" and learned how to obtain information from God.  \nOne thing that really helped me was to think about my God-given senses:  Eyesight, for example. Is it evil?  Of course not.  But ... what if it is used to view porn? Then is it evil?  No, not the eyesight, itself.  It is not evil.  Just as a gun is an inert piece of metal, until it is USED for evil.  \nOur psychic sense is simply another sense.  The Bible is full of examples of precognition, dreams, visions, etc.  The Bible is a very supernatural book!  In the Book of Joel it says, \"In the latter days, your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams.\"  This is happening.  \nCRV is simply a written process to help people separate true intuitive perception from just imagination.  It isn't any more evil than eyesight, hearing or any other sense you have.  What about eyeglasses to help you see better?  Are they evil?  No.  \nTo me, writing something off as evil or wrong is an indication of something I see all the time:  Fear.  We fear that which we do not understand.  Don't let fear keep you from living.","id":"5f752c2b1c7cd750301b9054","name":"The ethics of \"remote viewing\" according to a former Christian

According to Swann, his ability to see Jupiter took about three and a half minutes. In the session he made several reports on the physical features of Jupiter, such as its atmosphere and the surface of its core. Swann claimed to see bands of crystals in the atmosphere, which he likened to clouds and possibly like the rings of Saturn. The Voyager probe later confirmed the existence of the rings of Jupiter, although these rings are not in the planet's atmosphere. However, Swann's claim that crystals are present in the atmosphere is supported by observations by NASA's Galileo spacecraft of clouds of ammonia ice crystals in the northwest corner of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.\n\nRead about Voyager 1's detection of Jupiter's rings, from NASA:\nü™ê https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/vg1_p21259.html\n> Voyager 1 images gave the first indication of a faint ring around Jupiter.

Rob & Wendy:\n> We're ALL born with this innate ability to see & read without our eyes. It's both a God given ability, and EVERYONE has the right to learn it, just like we learn reading, writing and arithmetic in school as kids. There are many schools globally teaching this, and everyone has their own \"secret\" spin on, and charging sometimes exorbitant prices to teach it. Some attach religion to it as well. Eventually it'll be mainstream, taught by parents & in school. The truth is, we all can do it, it's a natural thing, but it's much easier when you're younger. I've seen people in their 70s reading blindfolded\n\nfrom Wendy:\n> I've been practising since Dec 2017 - Rob Freeman suggested that we go for training in Ottawa to start. At first I was the only one who didn‚Äôt see colours (the teacher said I was too old). I've been practicing and now can see colours, letters, shapes and even pictures in envelopes and at a distance. I've even moved on to bending spoons, seeing dice, and the side up when flipping coins.

Did you know the prophets of old weren't just born prophets?  They literally went to \"prophet school\" and learned how to obtain information from God.  \nOne thing that really helped me was to think about my God-given senses:  Eyesight, for example. Is it evil?  Of course not.  But ... what if it is used to view porn? Then is it evil?  No, not the eyesight, itself.  It is not evil.  Just as a gun is an inert piece of metal, until it is USED for evil.  \nOur psychic sense is simply another sense.  The Bible is full of examples of precognition, dreams, visions, etc.  The Bible is a very supernatural book!  In the Book of Joel it says, \"In the latter days, your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams.\"  This is happening.  \nCRV is simply a written process to help people separate true intuitive perception from just imagination.  It isn't any more evil than eyesight, hearing or any other sense you have.  What about eyeglasses to help you see better?  Are they evil?  No.  \nTo me, writing something off as evil or wrong is an indication of something I see all the time:  Fear.  We fear that which we do not understand.  Don't let fear keep you from living.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"dueReminder":null,"email":"felewin+2r08bk9nr0rwtukl28n+2v40t44yu1n11tq62j8+22y9xyee8m@boards.trello.com","idBoard":"5f4bee4cf7e3690309c0ba62","idChecklists":[],"idLabels":[],"idList":"5f4c1ebbbd2a5a81f85c067b","idMemberCreator":null,"idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idOrganization":"6125802363cee0583c156347","idShort":241,"idAttachmentCover":"5f752c2b1c7cd750301b905c","labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":800}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":400}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":56}}},"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":false,"name":"The

writes:\nüëç https://www.facebook.com/lori.williams.CRV1/posts/10220299997923022\n> Is CRV evil?  \nAs a former Christian missionary, I really considered the \"rightness\" or \"wrongness\" of CRV.  \nI used to teach Bible history.  Did you know the prophets of old weren't just born prophets?  They literally went to \"prophet school\" and learned how to obtain information from God.  \nOne thing that really helped me was to think about my God-given senses:  Eyesight, for example. Is it evil?  Of course not.  But ... what if it is used to view porn? Then is it evil?  No, not the eyesight, itself.  It is not evil.  Just as a gun is an inert piece of metal, until it is USED for evil.  \nOur psychic sense is simply another sense.  The Bible is full of examples of precognition, dreams, visions, etc.  The Bible is a very supernatural book!  In the Book of Joel it says, \"In the latter days, your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams.\"  This is happening.  \nCRV is simply a written process to help people separate true intuitive perception from just imagination.  It isn't any more evil than eyesight, hearing or any other sense you have.  What about eyeglasses to help you see better?  Are they evil?  No.  \nTo me, writing something off as evil or wrong is an indication of something I see all the time:  Fear.  We fear that which we do not understand.  Don't let fear keep you from

do; you have transcended the idea that you cannot, and have arrived outside of the mental trap by way of longer being interested.\n\n----\n\nA potential alternative to ever falling into the mental trap of \"practicing to acquire an ability you don't have\" (since of course, you really do have it already) is Dr. Joe Dispenza's approach of forming a belief that you are capable of doing something, by visualizing what it feels like to have already done it.\n\nAfter all, upon starting this practice, you most likely already have a belief that you cannot do it, because this is the mainstream understanding in society today. This is why kids seem to have such great success; nobody has told them that they can't do it, yet ‚Äì at least not as thoroughly as those of us who have been through many years of society and schooling.\n\nThis essentially leaves you with two approaches: try until you realize you can't do it ‚Äì and then you will ‚Äì or practice the state of knowing you can do it, and you will. The attached graphic illustrates this.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"dueReminder":null,"email":"felewin+2r08bk9nr0rwtukl28n+2v417jkzscffpfsxfpd+2niyf7grvh@boards.trello.com","idBoard":"5f4bee4cf7e3690309c0ba62","idChecklists":[],"idLabels":[],"idList":"5f4c0a1eab99c31915224f91","idMemberCreator":null,"idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idOrganization":"6125802363cee0583c156347","idShort":283,"idAttachmentCover":"5f75406f8838985f483d2506","labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":800}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":400}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":56}}},"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":true,"name":"‚ñ∂Ô∏è

resume\nThey'll try to push drugs that keep us all dumbed down\nAnd hope that we will never see the truth around\n(So come on)\nAnother promise, another seed\nAnother packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed\nAnd all the green belts wrapped around our minds\nAnd endless red tape to keep the truth confined\n(So come on)\nThey will not force us\nThey will stop degrading us\nThey will not control us\nWe will be victorious\n(So come on)\nInterchanging mind control\nCome let the revolution take its toll\nIf you could flick a switch and open your third eye\nYou'd see that we should never be afraid to die\n(So come on)\nRise up and take the power back\nIt's time the fat cats had a heart attack\nYou know that their time is coming to an end\nWe have to unify and watch our flag ascend\n(So come on)\nThey will not force us\nThey will stop degrading us\nThey will not control us\nWe will be victorious\n(So come on)\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nHey, hey, hey, hey\nThey will not

distinguishes remote viewing from intuition in general?\n\nRemote viewing is a particular https://trello.com/b/WtJPGwF0/intuition practice which uses the same intuitive faculties as other techniques, but is practiced via particular \"remote viewing\" protocols and is used as a term for a certain context: in association with military & government programs designed for intelligence gathering. Remote viewing, given the word 'viewing', focuses mostly on the visuals sensed intuitively, but is not limited to visuals. Some practitioners follow a particular protocol known as 'CRV' (controlled remote viewing).\n\nPhysicists https://trello.com/c/HLV2VOE6/121-%F0%9F%8E%AF-dr-russell-targ and https://trello.com/c/5G8YTVca/158-%F0%9F%94%AC-dr-harold-puthoff-%F0%9F%9B%B0%EF%B8%8F, parapsychology researchers at Stanford Research Institute (üìé photo), are generally credited with coining the term \"remote viewing\" to distinguish it from the closely related concept of clairvoyance, although according to Targ, the term was first suggested by Ingo Swann in December 1971 during an experiment at the American Society for Psychical Research in New York City (per https://trello.com/c/mAkGJimQ/107-%F0%9F%93%98-the-reality-of-esp-by-russell-targ). For the purposes of this board, clairvoyance is a term used to describe all abilities to tap into one's https://trello.com/b/WtJPGwF0/intuition. https://trello.com/b/WtJPGwF0/intuition then, as a concept, is more than just those clairvoyance abilities, but the study of the interconnectedness as well.\n\nRemote viewing was popularized in the 1990s upon the declassification of certain documents related to the Stargate Project, a $20 million research program that had started in 1975 and was sponsored by the U.S. government, in an attempt to determine any potential military application of psychic phenomena.\n\nCheck out https://trello.com/c/xxOfHOPd/193-%F0%9F%8E%96%EF%B8%8F-david-morehouse 's

distinguishes remote viewing from intuition in general?\n\nRemote viewing is a particular https://trello.com/b/WtJPGwF0/intuition practice which uses the same intuitive faculties as other techniques, but is practiced via particular \"remote viewing\" protocols and is used as a term for a certain context: in association with military & government programs designed for intelligence gathering. Remote viewing, given the word 'viewing', focuses mostly on the visuals sensed intuitively, but is not limited to visuals. Some practitioners follow a particular protocol known as 'CRV' (controlled remote viewing).\n\nPhysicists Russell Targ and Harold Puthoff, parapsychology researchers at Stanford Research Institute, are generally credited with coining the term \"remote viewing\" to distinguish it from the closely related concept of clairvoyance, although according to Targ, the term was first suggested by Ingo Swann in December 1971 during an experiment at the American Society for Psychical Research in New York City (per https://trello.com/c/mAkGJimQ/107-%F0%9F%93%98-the-reality-of-esp-by-russell-targ). For the purposes of this board, clairvoyance is a term used nearly interchangeably with https://trello.com/b/WtJPGwF0/intuition.\n\nRemote viewing was popularized in the 1990s upon the declassification of certain documents related to the Stargate Project, a $20 million research program that had started in 1975 and was sponsored by the U.S. government, in an attempt to determine any potential military application of psychic phenomena.","descData":{"emoji":{}},"due":null,"dueReminder":null,"email":"felewin+2r08bk9nr0rwtukl28n+2uyjw5cykvd267wf080+2li4ilh22x@boards.trello.com","idBoard":"5f4bee4cf7e3690309c0ba62","idChecklists":[],"idLabels":[],"idList":"5f512991e0868154cfdc4e93","idMemberCreator":null,"idMembers":[],"idMembersVoted":[],"idOrganization":"6125802363cee0583c156347","idShort":105,"idAttachmentCover":null,"labels":[],"limits":{"attachments":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":1000,"warnAt":800}},"checklists":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":500,"warnAt":400}},"stickers":{"perCard":{"status":"ok","disableAt":70,"warnAt":56}}},"locationName":null,"manualCoverAttachment":true,"name":"üéØ

Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Swann#Swann's_descriptions_of_Jupiter):\n> Swann asked for 30 minutes of silence. According to Swann, his ability to see Jupiter took about three and a half minutes. In the session he made several reports on the physical features of Jupiter, such as its atmosphere and the surface of its core. Swann claimed to see bands of crystals in the atmosphere, which he likened to clouds and possibly like the rings of Saturn. The Voyager probe later confirmed the existence of the rings of Jupiter, although these rings are not in the planet's atmosphere. However, Swann's claim that crystals are present in the atmosphere is supported by observations by NASA's Galileo spacecraft of clouds of ammonia ice crystals in the northwest corner of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.\n\nRead about Voyager 1's detection of Jupiter's rings, from NASA:\nü™ê https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/vg1_p21259.html\n> Voyager 1 images gave the first indication of a faint ring around Jupiter. The location of the ring is indicated by the white line. The thickness of the ring is estimated to be 30 km or less. Jupiter is about 142,000 km in diameter. The ring has a diameter of about 250,000 km.\n\n(üìé graphic of Jupiter with ring indicated)\n\n----\n\nCheck out other

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Swann#Swann's_descriptions_of_Jupiter):\n> Swann asked for 30 minutes of silence. According to Swann, his ability to see Jupiter took about three and a half minutes. In the session he made several reports on the physical features of Jupiter, such as its atmosphere and the surface of its core. Swann claimed to see bands of crystals in the atmosphere, which he likened to clouds and possibly like the rings of Saturn. The Voyager probe later confirmed the existence of the rings of Jupiter, although these rings are not in the planet's atmosphere. However, Swann's claim that crystals are present in the atmosphere is supported by observations by NASA's Galileo spacecraft of clouds of ammonia ice crystals in the northwest corner of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.\n\nRead about Voyager 1's detection of Jupiter's rings, from NASA:\nü™ê https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/vg1_p21259.html\n> Voyager 1 images gave the first indication of a faint ring around Jupiter. The location of the ring is indicated by the white line. The thickness of the ring is estimated to be 30 km or less. Jupiter is about 142,000 km in diameter. The ring has a diameter of about 250,000 km.\n\n(üìé graphic of Jupiter with ring indicated)\n\n----\n\nCheck out other

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingo_Swann#Swann's_descriptions_of_Jupiter):\n> Swann asked for 30 minutes of silence. According to Swann, his ability to see Jupiter took about three and a half minutes. In the session he made several reports on the physical features of Jupiter, such as its atmosphere and the surface of its core. Swann claimed to see bands of crystals in the atmosphere, which he likened to clouds and possibly like the rings of Saturn. The Voyager probe later confirmed the existence of the rings of Jupiter, although these rings are not in the planet's atmosphere. However, Swann's claim that crystals are present in the atmosphere is supported by observations by NASA's Galileo spacecraft of clouds of ammonia ice crystals in the northwest corner of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.\n\nRead about Voyager 1's detection of Jupiter's rings, from NASA:\nü™ê https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/vg1_p21259.html\n> Voyager 1 images gave the first indication of a faint ring around Jupiter. The location of the ring is indicated by the white line. The thickness of the ring is estimated to be 30 km or less. Jupiter is about 142,000 km in diameter.
